There is money in the internet. That is the simple answer I give to people who keep asking me what I spend hours on end in my house doing.

The internet is like one big shopping mall full of consumers who can’t wait to spend their money on your affiliate products if you are convincing enough.

Affiliate marketing success starts with a willingness to market your website. Alas! Your blog is a marketing tool that must also be marketed!

### Here are my tips on marketing your blog for affiliate marketing success

1.  **Blog Design and Responsiveness**

Website marketing starts from the basic design to the functionality and interactivity that your site lets your visitors have.

You should always view your website as an advertising tool. It is the sole tool that will allow you to carry on passive marketing of your affiliate products after you have successfully set it up with search-engine optimized content.

One of the key features that determine the effectiveness of your website is the web hosting company you have chosen.

Your web host needs to have enough uptime to not frustrate your website leads. I host some of my websites with Hostgator since they are cheap and dependable.

You can sign up for hosting with hostgator with just a penny. Use my special coupon code 1centblogs when registering to qualify for the one penny hosting plan.

2.  **Pay Per Click Advertising**

If you can master the art of web marketing, you can make a lot of money online in a very short amount of time. You should aim to learn the little stuff such as search engine pay per click advertising.

It is the small stuff that adds up to so much money online. Improper use of these tactics will however leave you wondering what exactly hit your wallet.

Like every other form of advertising, web marketing can cost you a lot of money. Luckily, whatever you pay for PPC blog promotion is an infinitesimal amount compared to what you would have paid in traditional advertising media such as television and newspapers.

With PPC, you only pay when someone clicks on your ads.

Apart from the cost-effectiveness, another major advantage of using PPC on your affiliate blog site is the level of precise targeting that PPC offers.

3.  **Add A Newsletter To Your Affiliate Marketing Blog**

People are always in the lookout for new knowledge. It doesn’t matter the amount of newsletters that are being offered out there, there is still room for yours. You can set up your blog’s newsletter for \$1.00 using the trial version of the Aweber Autoresponder.

Remember that the secret to effectively setting up your newsletter and keeping the subscribers subscribed is to have information that they are actively looking for. Give them this information. Save them from the hassle of going after it, and they will thank you with more conversions. To achieve this, you must be willing to invest time in studying industry news.

To get subscribers to join your mailing list in troops, design a website optin form using Aweber and place it on a strategic point in your website. You may also want to give out free goodies to woo the subscribers. E-books and trial versions of digital products work magic here. In my current subscriber drive, I am giving out a free ‘Blogging for Money e-course that you can [register here](https://mahinge.com/blogging-tutorials-now).

Once you have subscribers in your list, you will need to schedule consistent follow-ups that are relevant to what your audience’s interests. The Aweber Autoresponder lets you create email follow-ups that will go out at the time and day you specify. You can see it in action here for \$1.00 only.

If you can grow your email list to thousands of subscribers, you can be assured of a ready market for your information and affiliate products.
