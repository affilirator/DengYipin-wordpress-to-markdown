**1. The world doesn’t really care where you came from.**

Don’t think that you need to have a certain background to make it to the top. If you’re lucky enough to be born in a free country, or you’re able to make it to one, you have a shot. You can be a political refugee with an accent, a scar, no money, no skills, and no connections, but you’re free to decide at any point to not let it hold you back.

**2. The world can be yours…**

Using nothing but street smarts and determination, Tony Montana achieved his vision of the American Dream. He had money, power, respect…everything he always wanted.

**3. …but it comes at a price.**

On the other hand, he was lucky to even survive long enough to get to that point, and it ended up costing him everything. Before you pursue something, know what the price is, and decide whether you’re willing to pay it. And don’t envy someone until you know what they’ve been through to get to where there are.

**4. Don’t underestimate the other guy’s greed.**

This was lesson number one from Frank Lopez, and Tony ignored it. If you’re standing in the way of someone who will stop at nothing in their fanatical pursuit of power, you might want to watch out for them.

**5. Don’t get high on your own supply.**

This was lesson number two from Frank Lopez, and Tony ignored it as well. Of course, literally staying off drugs is always a good idea (as well as moderating your consumption of alcohol and caffeine). But beyond that, you don’t want to get so absorbed in what you’re doing that you forget who you are.

**6. The guys that last are the guys who fly straight. Low-key, quiet. But the guys who want it all, chicas, champagne, flash…they don’t last.**

(You know, if Tony listened to Frank once in a while, things would have turned out very differently.) Don’t obsess about the pie in the sky. Stay focused and don’t get greedy, and you’ll win in the long run.

**7. When you get involved with the wrong people, sometimes no decision is the right one.**

Tony sealed his doom when he refused to carry out a hit after the target’s wife and two kids unexpectedly got in the car. He had to choose between sacrificing three innocent people and sacrificing himself. This is why you don’t want to work with people whose values are different from yours. There will be a conflict of interests at some point, and possibly no way out.

**8. All you have in this world is your balls and your word—don’t break them for anyone.**

This isn’t literally true—you have much more than that—but the point is to live by your own code of ethics. If a criminal can do it, then we certainly can too.

**9. Every day above ground is a good day.**

Be gracious for what you have. Very often we take things for granted until they’re gone.

**10. Don’t kill your best friend for no reason.**

Kind of an obvious lesson, but important nonetheless. Relationships that take years to build can take an instant to destroy, so don’t act hastily.

**11. When people want to play rough, you can either say “I give up” or “Say hello to my little friend!”**

Everyone faces seemingly unwinnable showdowns at some point. Sometimes surrender is the best option, and sometimes it isn’t. But if you’re going to make a stand, then really do it.

**12. Be careful when naming something after something else.**

Oliver Stone named Tony Montana after his favorite football player, Joe Montana. The problem is that giving him a non-Cuban name destroys the illusion of the movie. He might as well have called him Tony Navratilova or Tony Abdul-Jabbar. Other people might not have the same attachment to your creation’s namesake that you do. Keep this in mind before calling your company something like Joe Montana Software, because all that matters is what other people think of it.

**13. If the rose smells sweet enough, someone will be willing to snip off the thorns.**

Editing _Scarface_ for network TV presented some serious challenges, most notably finding someone willing to dub out 226 f-words. But someone decided it was worth doing, and got it done.

**14. Have a contingency plan.**

In the final shootout, Al Pacino badly burned his hand by grabbing his gun by the barrel, and had to sit out for a few weeks. Fortunately, they were able to use this time somewhat productively by shooting a lot of footage of the other people in this scene. It could have been a lot worse. You want to identify your high-risk areas, do what you can to mitigate the risk, and know what you’ll do if things fall through.
