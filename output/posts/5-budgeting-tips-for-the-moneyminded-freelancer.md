Successful budgeting depends on two things. Having a stable income and being able to stick to the plans that you have made. While everyone can manage to pull off the first requirement, not everyone has a stable source of income. I am talking about those of us who [make money online](http://www.kenyanpridespot.com/freelance-store/ "freelance store") through freelancing and other related ventures.

One month you will be laughing all the way to the bank, and then the next month, if you are not careful enough or you do not work HARD enough, you will have to find a good reason to visit your most personable neighbor during mealtimes.

With the unpredictable financial fluctuations that hit your freelancing career from time to time, you may feel like you do not need to budget our personal finance. And come to think of it, can you really manage to make a strict monthly budget when you are depending on the money you make online for your survival?

I believe you can and you should be living on budget.

_**Understanding Budgeting Tips**_

Basically speaking, a budget is a way of finding out how much money you need to accomplish your day to day life. If you are a smarter budgeter, you will be able to live within your budget. If you are not a smart budget, not even having a 9-5 job will save your personal finance quagmires.

Budgeting is especially crucial to freelancers and other groups of people who make money online. Your monthly budget is not guaranteed. One budgeting mistake and you are out in the street with the urchins.

1.  _**Take a Firm Control of Your Online Income**_

One of the things that you must put to mind when you start freelancing is that your online income is highly unpredictable and irregular. You do not have a paycheck waiting for you at the end of the month.

The characteristic of working from the internet is that one month you will have a lot of money coming in, and then the next month the dry spell comes knocking.

Understanding this will let you approach the money you are making cautiously. Donâ€™t spend your money as it trickles into your freelancing accounts.

The best of taking control of your online income is to understand your cashflow. How much money is hitting your account and how much are you spending?

Using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets can help you do this analytical math. List your expenses on one column and the money you have at hand, in your freelance accounts and the money your clients are still to remit. Dividing the total monthly income with the monthly expenses should give you an average of how many months you have before going bust.
