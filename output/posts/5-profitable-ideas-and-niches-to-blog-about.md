Are you thinking of starting a blog? One of the greatest challenges to any new blogger is finding enjoyable and profitable blog ideas.

What can you blog about to ensure that you do not burn out and you make money with your blog?

Here is my list of five blog ideas that can generate you some incredible income:

1\. Health and Fitness- The health and fitness theme is always ever green. If you decide to start a blog on the health and fitness niche, ensure that you have found a subniche in it. One of the subniches that completely rocks right now is the butt firming topic.

2\. Fashion and Beauty- Women all over the world love beauty and quite uncoincidentally, the fashion and beauty niche rocks! Here, you can blog about eye makeup, trench coats..... 3. Games and Sports- There is no doubt about it. Games and sports are popular with everyone in the world. Keywords that are related to sports also have a very high CPC in Google Adsense. If you can manage to create a very specific blog that deals with one sport, you could be on your way to becoming a blogger billionaire.

4\. Electronics and Gadgets- Yeah! You are not the only one who wants to gets hands on the next iPhone before it leaves the manufacturer's studio. Electronics and gadgets niche rocks!

5\. Diseases and Wellness- Unfortunately, this world, especially the Western World is full of sick people. Although the disease and medical niches is quite tricky to enter, those who manage to get in make a tidy sum.
