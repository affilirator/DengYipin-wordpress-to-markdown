When you launch a new Amazon site, or a new Adsense money site, what’s the first thing on your mind? Are you the type of person who feels that you need to start building backlinks immediately, ping your new site daily and send out thousands of tweets through a Fiverr gig? If so, you could be taking the completely wrong approach to building your money sites. Today’s post is going to be about why you should take your time when building new sites, and focus on a quality natural link profile as opposed to one that screams MONEY MONEY MONEY. Listen, Google isn’t interested in sites that’s primary focus is earning money through affiliate commissions and advertisements. Amazon and other online retailers are different, because they actually provide a valuable consumer experience. Your little Amazon site offering reviews on the latest Chainsaws offers no value whatsoever and chances are, your reviews are a bunch of crap and you haven’t tried or tested the Chainsaw, and you most definitely haven’t purchased it.

I believe that Google works on a trust factor. As your site continues to produce quality content, you are slowly rewarded with more trust and authority. This process takes time. Sure, you can achieve insane amounts of authority short-term and profit quite well. A simple search for “Payday loans” in the UK reveals a PR0 site with no backlinks. Why’s it there you ask? The owner has probably bought 500 Fiverr gigs and 50,000 tweets. The results are short-term. Now, yes, he will profit short-term and he will probably get more profits back on his initial investment, but this isn’t a long-term strategy. You see, there’s two approaches you can take with Internet Marketing, and you need to decide which approach you’re going to take.

**Are you going to keep building short-term sites that earn you cash, but get hit within days, weeks or even months?**

OR

**are you going to start focusing on building sites that maintain rankings for years to come, and provide you with a solid residual income for potentially, the rest of your life?**

### Why I believe Google awards a “trust” factor

I have been building Authority sites now for two years. I also build small money sites as you may already know. However, I have noticed consistently better results with my authority sites throughout my time. Likewise, none of my authority sites have ever been hit from a major algorithm changes. Their traffic has been consistent and continues to improve as each month passes by. I don’t worry about them, and I now build automated backlinks to them. Why, you ask? Well, first of all, take a link at the current link profile of one of my authority sites.
