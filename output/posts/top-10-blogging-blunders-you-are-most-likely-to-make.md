Knowing your mistakes can help you become a better blogger and eventually create a better blog.

These top ten blogging blunders are basic mistakes you might make. Basics are the most important part because lack of foundation means lack of strength after you blog is ready to blossom.

OK friends… Let’s get to work then!

Below are ten points hand crafted by me. Each point carries a basic description about it, an action plan, and a useful and inspirational quote and few other posts that I recommend you to read. Follow the entire post to make the most of it.

## Blogging Only For Money

**Action Plan:**

You can earn from advertisers and in many other ways like affiliate marketing, Adsense, Contextual advertisements, etc.

But always remember this, money comes in great amount when it’s mixed with passion.

Passion is the magical element that makes your blog posts more amazing than any other blog posts in your niche.

Blogging without passion is like “Internet without Web browsers!” You might have just started a blog or may be owning a good blog in terms of traffic, but if money is your ONLY goal, you may find it difficult to go long and succeed.

Here’s the deal. If you want an amazing blog with a massive amount of visitors, question yourself, “Why do I blog?”. If your mind answers “Money”, think again and find a better reason to blog.

Passion will help you to survive the hard times when your blog gets less traffic and people don’t find people interacting at your blog. Blogging is a task that needs perseverance.

## Success Is Quick

**Action Plan:**

This one is a common blunder made by almost everyone.

Success doesn’t come quickly because it requires a lot of hard work. This work not only involves reading other blogs, writing superb blog posts, commentating on other blogs and socializing, but it has something else too.

It’s thinking & planning!

Have you ever wondered why a strategist in any vocation gets more wages than an average worker? His pay is just a little below to that of the group leader.

Why is that?

It’s because if you don’t plan out your actions, your time will be wasted and your work won’t be efficient.

First make a clear and concise goal, a goal that’s huge! Even if it’s to beat Mashable, don’t be scared. Write it down somewhere you can easily see it everyday. Now have a look at your position and make baby step plans. Keep small milestones, make gradual improvements and eventually achieve your goal!

## Not Valuing Your Readers

**Action Plan:**

This one is something that matters most. When you don’t value your reader’s opinions, they feel neglected and may go to some other blog.

_Some symptoms that show that you don’t value your readers:_

- Not answering to comments.
- Not replying to emails.
- Not replying to Twitter messages and @ replies.
- Not valuing your reader’s opinions.
- Not writing on what your readers love to read.
- Not implementing user suggestions.

Always welcome your readers, give them easy ways to contact you, respond to their questions and suggestions and you will see the number of readers rising.

## Not Tuning Your Blog

**Action Plan:**

This point mostly applies to WordPress users but even for other blogging platforms this matters a lot. The design of the blog, blog categories, blog logo, blog tag line, blog plugins, blog pages, blog theme, everything matters a lot.

These tips matter for all blogging platforms.

#### _Theme & Layout:_

First and foremost chose a good theme with a nice layout. Professional and personal blogs should have different types of designs.

The look and feel of your website matters a lot.

Have a look at Blogscheme and [Problogger.net](http://www.problogger.net/). These are professional blogs. Now have a look at this blog. See the difference? Blogscheme and Problogger have a different look (professional look) as compared to my other blog which uses a Tumblog theme. So in short choose a blog theme wisely.

#### _Plug-ins:_

Use various plugins for your blog. Just for example use plugins to show the best posts of your blog, most commented posts, recent tweets, etc. These plugins will double the user interaction!

#### _Categories, Pages, Logo, Tagline:_

These things spice up your blog. I asked Pubudu (My best blogging buddy) about categorizing one day because [TechHamlet](http://www.techhamlet.com/) has a lot of informative categories.

He answered that he makes the categories as he writes his blog posts. Create categories wisely, categories for each different subject have a good effect as it allows easy browsing of the content within that category.

Then comes the tag line. This is important and it should reflect everything you share in your blog.

Problogger's, Darren Rowse, in his book “[31 Days To Build A Better Blog](http://www.problogger.net/31dbbb-workbook/)” explains in the first chapter about pitching the blog.

Pages are really important for every blog. Contact pages help your visitors reach you. Advertise here pages tell advertisers about your blog stats and will help you get advertisers.

Further adding pages will also help you increase Adsense approval chances.

## Blogging Alone… Lonely..

**Action Plan:**

Blogging is something that makes communities to foster. Bloggers should get together, discuss issues and solve their problems. Blogging with a community is fun too. You can easily get backlinks and improve your blog’s ranking too.

Relationships in life matter the most. So do they in blogging. Don’t try to blog alone. This reduces the links you get and progressing will be harder.

To [start forming a community ](https://mahinge.com/talking-bad-networking/)you can write guest posts for a few blog that you know. From your blog articles you can link to other blogs.

Many a times the other blogger will reciprocate this. If not you can request them to do so. If someone declines to link, don’t get harsh and remove the links to their site. Some bloggers just don’t like to link to others. That’s it!

## Not Reading Enough

**Action Plan:**

This might cause you to fail completely in life and in blogging. I personally use to say ro myself – “A man who says he has no time to read is bound to be an epic fail” to remind me of this fact.

Go out there and read great blogs. Find out about great bloggers. A few of them are [Darren Rowse](http://www.problogger.net/), [Amit Bhawani](http://www.amitbhawani.com/) and [Chris Garrett](http://www.chrisg.com/). Google about them, their life, success stories and I am sure they will help you be a better blogger.

Another thing you can do to give a boost to your reading habit is to subscribe to RSS feeds of various sites, be it news, be it anime or gaming, be it anything.

You can join sites belonging to your favorite niche.

My RSS feed reader is filled with feeds from CSS-Tricks and many other similar sites. This helps in being up to date with latest happenings in these fields as well as increases my reading habit.

## Content Is Not Important

**Action Plan:**

Content is king, as they say. This might be something you have heard over and over again. Content is king! Repeat it well because you need to write good content to get active readers, backlinks and the must – reputation.

Remember there is no substitute to awesome content. When you have good quality content Google will be in love with your blog. Even if it takes time to write a quality post try it out and see. The response you will receive will be worth each word you have written.

And remember this important point – It’s not quantity that makes a great blog, it’s quality. Have a look at [Seth Godin’s blog](http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/) and you will understand what I mean to say.

Write a post consisting a lot of valuable information, a post that helps people and which people will consider bookmarking. The best way to find such a topic is to ask yourself what would be valuable to you and what would you bookmark when you come across content.

## SEO Is Hard

**Action Plan:**

SEO is not a hard thing. SEO needs patience and a lot of practice. I won’t discuss about it much.

Google about SEO and start reading articles about the same.

## Wrong Tone

**Action Plan:**

Even in writing stories, I learned about this. The tone tells the reader who you are and what you think about.

So whats the big deal about your tone?

Have you read a newspaper reporting latest something? You will notice that its just written out. A good blog post is a conversation not an article.

Think of it… That’s why what bloggers write are called posts and what reporters write are called articles. So remember to write like as if you’re talking to someone directly.

To get more knowledge about this type of writing, take a fiction book and read it fully. Now have a look at the book title, titles of various chapters and the author. There is only a single author (Make sure to take a single author book!) But the characters were like real. Analyze how they talk and you will learn to write perfect blog posts.

What makes blogs special from a Wikipedia article is that there is something personal about a post. Try to be personal. It helps…

\[su_divider]

## Wrong Blog Title & Niche

**Action Plan:**

This is something that I learned from Techhamlet.com. Techhamlet was first called as Earth-org.com.

Earth-org.com sounds like an environmental site but the content is entirely about technology. But when you hear the name Techhamlet, you will understand that it’s about tech.

That’s why you should chose a good domain and a title for your blog. The next thing that you must consider is the niche of your blog.

Avoid mixing niches. Contribute tech posts on a tech blog and anime posts on an anime blog. Find a niche and stick to it. Keep on expanding your niche as you move.
