A few days ago, I went into a deeper analysis of the [type of blog that will make you the most money](https://mahinge.com/type-blog-will-make-money/ "What Type of a Blog Will Make You the Most Money?"). The response was simply astounding and thanks to everyone who has used my affiliate link to register for a hosting account in [iPage](https://mahinge.com/visit/iPage) or [Bluehost](https://mahinge.com/visit/Bluehost)! ON the other hand, there has been several questions raised about how you can actually start earning money with a **niche website**.

So, today I would love to talk about a subject that has become dear to my heart; **blog monetization**. The term may sound scientific if you are new to blogging as a source of passive income. It simply means making money with your blog.

I have listed the the most commonly asked questions in regard to blog monetization. Click on your favorite social media account to reveal the questions or scroll down to continue reading the rest of the post.

1.  When can you start earning money with your blog
2.  How do you make money with your blog
3.  How much money can you make from a blog

To answer the above questions, I will use myself, or rather my newest niche website, as a case study. Tighten your seatbelt, and prepare for another illuminating journey into the world of blogging.

## When Can I Start Earning Money With My Blog

If you have researched your niche market well, done a thorough keyword research and generally followed my advice about creating a profitable blog, you can start making money with your blog from day one provided you have very valuable content to offer your blog visitors.

Realistically, you should be able to make the first few dollars within the first 30 or so days of launching your niche website. But how do you make this money?

## How Do you Make Money With Your Blog

You have probably read about how you can become an affiliate/marketer for products, join a few affiliate programmes such as Commission Junction, Share-a-Sale, Viglink or infolinks?

Really? Does that stuff even work?

I have tried it. I still have the code for infolinks stuck in my [oldest blog](http://www.kenyanpridespot.com/make-money-online-find-much-earned-february/ "make money online"), and I can tell you for free. If you are starting a niche blog targeting to make money from these affiliate programs, you would be better off doing something else.

There is only ONE affiliate site that I trust when it comes to blog monetization, especially if this is your first site and you do not have an Adsense account. [Join Amazon Associates](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/join/landing/main.html "Amazon Associates").

### Why Amazon Associates?

Remember what we said when we were discussing [types of blogs that make money](https://mahinge.com/type-blog-will-make-money/ "blogs that make money")?

We talked about knowing and targeting your market with a keyword. That is what I did with my Weight Bench Reviews Site.

Most of your keywords should be for products that are already on sale online. I can name quite a few including Chinese Knives, Black Tea Blends, Mascaras and eyeliners among others.

When your blog is focused on such a niche, it is very easy to find products in Amazon to _**monetize your**_** blog, **and unlike many other affiliate programs, Amazon Associates does not require your blog to be established with tons of visitors for you to be accepted into their program.

The commissions offered by Amazon Associates are quite low, but if you have researched your keywords well and optimized your blog to rank in the first page of Google (remind me to write about ranking your website on the first page of Google), you should start seeing the fruits of your labor quite soon.

If, unfortunately you are unable to make your blog rank, don't lose hope. You can always use Google's Adwords Program to advertise your blog and drive more traffic or use Social Media to drive traffic. Every time a visitor clicks an Amazon affiliate link on your blog, and buys a product in Amazon, you will earn a commission for the sale!

### A Quick Word About Google Adsense

Google Adsense is an advertising program from Google. When you sign up for the adsense program (not so fast buddy), Google will place ads on your blog and pay you every time the ads are seen or clicked.

Google is strict about who they let into their program and will require that you
