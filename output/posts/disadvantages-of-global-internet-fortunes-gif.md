### Is Global Internet Fortunes Legit?

Yes. Global Internet Fortunes is a legit company in the sense that it provides real products and services. However, the amount of money you can make selling the company's products is very often exaggerated. Additionally, the fact that GIF relies heavily on the refferal/recruitment of new members points to it being a pyramid scheme and the business model is not sustainable. Pyramid schemes often operate under the context of "**Rob Peter to Pay Paul.**"

### What do Global Internet Fortunes Sell?

Global Internet Fortunes claims to sell domain names, web hosting services, and email marketing software. The company has recently updated their website to include some health and nutition products as some of the products they sell. But don't let this facade fool you.

Anyway, I have comprehensively covered the review of Global Internet Fortunes from the very beginning. Below is my assessment of the company. Please note that whether I've refferred to it as SocialBizConnect, Internet Marketing Africa or SBC, this rview is for the one and only Global Internet Fortunes LTD.

## Update: SocialBizConnect aka Internet Marketing Africa changed name to Global Internet Fortunes

<!-- /wp:generateblocks/headline -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

What do you think of a company that keeps changing its name? SocialBizConnect changed its name to Global Internet Fortunes. So, in this review, you may find the name Social Biz Connect and Global Internet Fortunes being used interchangeably. They both refer to the same company whose CEO is Mr. Kimathi Kamunde. Let's dive in to find whether Global Internet Fortunes is legit, as well as discuss its advantages and disadvantages.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:generateblocks/container -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I have openly spoken about ~~SocialBizConnect~~ Global Internet Fortunes in other forums and have been called a ‘hater’ for my criticism.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But are my assertions that **~~SocialBizConnect~~ Global Internet Fortunes is a scam** baseless?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

No.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I have tangible evidence to prove that _**SocialBizConnect and its sister-in-scam Internet Marketing Africa will soon crumble**_ and leave many Kenyans more financially desperate than they initially were.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Here are some of the key pointers that SocialBizConnect is headed for damnation even before it gets to its ‘official launch date’ on 30th April. Read them and don't forget to[ leave your comments ](https://mahinge.com/socialbizconnect-sbc-kenya-review/#comment)at the end of the post about what you really think about SocialBizConnect.

## Kimathi Kamunde - CEO of Global Internet Fortunes

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":14878,"align":"center"} -->

![Kimathi Kamundeh SocialBizConnect and Internet Marketing Africa](./images/wp-content-uploads-2017-07-is-global-internet-fortunes-genuine.jpg)

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A few months ago, Kimathi Kamundeh a.k.a. Lloyd Kim (pictured above) the CEO of Global Internet Fortunes Kenya was the mastermind behind another Kenyan scam by the name of My Fortunes Builder.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Like Global Internet Fortunes, My Fortunes Builder Stole from Kenyans by inviting them to attend seminars for a business that was never going to launch.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The company was to launch on 7th January 2013. The problem is that** it never launched** as[ this banner (which is a screenshot of the now abandoned MFB website) indicates.](https://web.archive.org/web/20130320082345/http://myfortunesbuilder.com/)

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The 'launch' of My Fortunes Builder was preceded by the same hype that SocialBizConnect Kenya is experiencing and the same paid for seminars...

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### Then? What happened?

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Only Kimathi Kamunde can answer this question.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

However, a very inquisitive person can see how this works out. You are being invited for seminars in Nairobi. Seminars that teach you nothing you do not already know. Seminars that are the only thing you will ever get from SBC since the company will never launch.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Lloyd Kim is making money from you and your friends as you attend his prelaunch seminars. Good luck to you and your invitees if SBC ever launches.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The striking similarities between My Fortune Builder and SBC are simply undeniable. In fact, one could argue that the two websites are Siamese twins albeit with some idiotic twists like the Power of 4 becoming the Power of 5 in SBC.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And is it a coincidence that the two companies are launching at the beginning of the year when there are a lot of desperate Form Four leavers looking for online money?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mr. Kimathi does not even deny that he was the architect behind My Fortunes Builder. But the scornful look you get when you probe into this not-too-distance past is enough to cow even the bravest of hearts.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I particularly sought to know what led to the failure of My Fortunes Builder and what measures have been taken to ensure that SocialBizConnect does not go the way of MFB but my questions were met with insults and sneers.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Of course a lot of Kenyans who are running to join SocialBizConnect do not even know there was such a company like MFB that stole money from Kenyans and went under.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Until Lloyd Kim provides answers to explain what he intends to do differently with SBC that he didn’t do with MFB, we can confidently assume that SBC is another scam.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In fact, it lives up to the trends that have been observed with all [MLM scams](https://mahinge.com/legitimate-work-home-jobs/ "MLM Scams"). They die and resurrect as other companies offering even juicier online moneymaking opportunities.

## Global Internet Fortune is a Pyramid Scheme Scam that Will Soon Crumble

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:generateblocks/image {"uniqueId":"f71de581","mediaId":17896,"sizeSlug":"full","alignment":"center","blockVersion":2} -->

![socialbizconnect kenya is a scam](./images/wp-content-uploads-2017-07-socialbizconnect-kenya-is-a-scam.png "socialbizconnect kenya is a scam")

<!-- /wp:generateblocks/image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

You can [easily recognize a genuine opportunity from a scam](https://mahinge.com/legitimate-work-home-jobs/) by simply stripping all the colourful ads and seducing dialogue from it. You can tell which is viable online opportunity and which one will only waste your time, energy and money. The barebones version of SocialBizConnect has all the pointers of being headed nowhere.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### **1. The only way you can really [earn money](https://mahinge.com/can-make-money-freelancing-kenya/ "earn money freelance writing") in Global Internet Fortunes is by inviting people to the paid-entry seminars**

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

No one is very enthusiastic to join the SocialBizConnect Business Club, which promises to pay referrers \$6 for every successful referral.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Why would any businessperson pay \$18 to place his ads on a platform that has zero members online at any given time? It doesn’t make sense more so considering that you can get some pretty more sales with Facebook ads at that monthly budget.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This leaves SBC members with only one viable earning opportunity- finding as many idiots as they can possibly do to attend the seminars where they charge 200/= at the entrance, something that is not very sustainable.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### **2. The products that Global Internet Fortune ‘Sells’ do not have a market in Kenya**

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Some of the MLMs manage to exist {and continue milking money from unsuspecting citizens} for a little while due to the irresistible nature of products that they purport to sell; products that make the promise of wealth, health or both.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

SocialBizConnect has however tied a noose around its already frail life by trying to sell internet marketing products that

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- Do not have a market in Kenya
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->
-
- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- Cannot outperform the established brands in the market
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The products include autoresponders, ebooks {most of which are regurgitated PLR junk} and Microsoft Packages videos! Not surprisingly, MFB was selling the same-same products. I honestly thought that Lloyd Kim would learn from his mistakes with MFB and find some hot-selling products to build around his [internet marketing scam](https://mahinge.com/online-scam-surveys/ "Online paid surveys"). Too bad, and that says something about his reasoning...

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Only a fool would keep doing the same thing over and over again and expect different results.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### **3. GIF Has The worst sales team in the world**

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":14876,"align":"center"} -->

![social biz connect kenya](./images/wp-content-uploads-2017-07-social-biz-connect-kenya-300x146.png)

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Internet marketing deserves patience, an unfailing perseverance and strategy. Most of the people signing for Social Biz Connect in Kenya are in it for the fast cash. They have idiotically trusted what the banners tell them. They do not know what market segment to target with the tools that Lloyd Kim is offering.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

From the above points, there is only one conclusion to be drawn about SocialBizConnect. It is one of the poorest drawn multilevel marketing (MLM) scams to ever be construed. Even if it ever launches (which I am willing to bet it won't as Kim is only interested in your seminar money) SocialBizConnect cannot survive for more than a few months without sinking...

## Disadvantages of Global Internet Fortunes

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Here are 7 points to consider before joining Global Internet Fortunes or any other pyramid scheme:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->

1.  <!-- wp:list-item -->
2.  Pyramid schemes are illegal in most countries, including Kenya. If you participate in Global Internet Fortunes, you could face legal consequences such as fines and imprisonment.
3.  <!-- /wp:list-item -->
4.
5.  <!-- wp:list-item -->
6.  The vast majority of people who join pyramid schemes, including Global Internet Fortunes, lose their money. Only a small number of people at the top of the pyramid make significant profits.
7.  <!-- /wp:list-item -->
8.
9.  <!-- wp:list-item -->
10. The structure of a pyramid scheme means that it is not sustainable and will eventually collapse. When this happens, most people, including you, will lose their investment.
11. <!-- /wp:list-item -->
12.
13. <!-- wp:list-item -->
14. In order to keep a pyramid scheme going, constantly new members are needed. This means that you will have to continuously try to recruit your friends and family to join, which can damage your relationships.
15. <!-- /wp:list-item -->
16.
17. <!-- wp:list-item -->
18. Many pyramid schemes, including Global Internet Fortunes, use misleading or false information to recruit new members. This means that you may not fully understand the risks and disadvantages of participating.
19. <!-- /wp:list-item -->
20.
21. <!-- wp:list-item -->
22. Participating in a pyramid scheme can harm your reputation. When the scheme collapses and people lose their money, you may be seen as someone who was responsible for their financial loss.
23. <!-- /wp:list-item -->
24.
25. <!-- wp:list-item -->
26. There are many legitimate ways to make money online in Kenya, such as [becoming a freelance writer](https://mahinge.com/winning-elance-odesk-freelance-jobs-kenya/), [investing in forex trading](https://mahinge.com/forex-trading-in-kenya/), or working as an [Amazon affiliate marketer](https://mahinge.com/amazon-affiliate-kenya/). These options are much safer and more financially sound than participating in a pyramid scheme like Global Internet Fortunes.

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->

1.  <!-- wp:list-item -->

7.  <!-- /wp:list-item -->
8.
9.  <!-- wp:list-item -->
10. **Vague or undisclosed business practices**: A legitimate company should be transparent about its business practices and should be able to clearly explain how it generates revenue.
