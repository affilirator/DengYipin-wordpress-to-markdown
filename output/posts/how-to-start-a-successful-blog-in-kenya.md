### Choosing a Niche for Your Blog

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If you want to make money blogging in Kenya, you need to carefully choose the topic for your blog. Treat it like a business and it will earn you money for years to come. So, how do you do this?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Every blog should have a niche**. A niche is a topic which you can confidently write about with a lot of authority. Some of the most common blog niches in Kenya include fashion, sports, cooking, travel, and business.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There's a catch, however. Try to be as unique as possible in your blog. Don't do what everyone else is doing.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

For instance, if you've chosen fashion as your niche, instead of blogging generic fashion information, how about going for **environmental conscious fashion** as a niche? That instantly sets you apart from a multitude of other fashion bloggers in Kenya.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The niche for this blog leans towards **making money online in Kenya**. You'll rarely find other topics not related to making money on this blog. That's my niche. It is what I know best. And what I can write about with a lot of authority.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->

> Don't blog about just anything that comes to mind. Many Kenyans make the mistake of turning their blogs into personal scrapbooks.

<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Such a blog where you post your personal life escapades is more of a scrapbook than a business blog. Like, take an example if you wanted to make money from blogging by having companies place ads on your blog. Do you think a company is interested in your life? Nope. Unless you're one of the best known influencers in Kenya.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### Get a Domain Name and Web Hosting for Your Blog

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This is the little technical part about starting a blog in Kenya. But don't panic. Starting a blog is not rocket science and anyone with some basic information can do it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The two things you need to get your blog rolling is a domain and web hosting. There are two approaches to these. You can choose to go with free blogging options or choose to create your own custom website.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

We'll take you through the two options, including the pros and cons for each so that you can make the right decision for your business blog.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->

#### 1. Free Blogging Platforms in Kenya

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Free blogging options are good if you want to blog as a hobby. They make it very easy to start blogging.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

However, as you'll soon learn, the allure of the free blogging platforms is short-lived**. There are more limitations than advantages with free blogging sites**. For starters, no one will take you seriously when you're blogging on a free blogging platform.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Additionally, many of the free blogging sites do not allow you to place banners or affiliate links on the site. This greatly limits your available income streams.
