Today I want to share one of the best link building strategies that anyone will ever share with you for free.

For lack of a creativity, I simply call it 301 Redirects- exactly what it does.

## How do you do it?

### 1. Buy an expired/deleted domain name.

You can find these in many places including domaincop, Flippa, Sedo, ExpiredDomains.Net Among others.

![301 redirects link building](./images/wp-content-uploads-2016-12-Aljazeera-Broken-Links-300x136.png)I personally like scrapping the web for my own domains using Ahrefs.

What I do is take a strong domain name such as Aljazeera.com, plug it into Ahrefs' site explorer, and scroll down to where we have broken links. This gives a list of pages that the website is linking to, but those pages don't exist anymore.

When a crawler finds a broken link, it will identify it using several error codes.

- **404 Not Found**: This is for page not found, which typically means the website is there but that particular page might have been removed, its url changed or something else. But the domain name exists and it's hosted somewhere
- **Cannot Resolve Host**: This is the kind of broken link error that flutters my heart. If a crawler cannot resolve host, it means that that website is not on the internet.

Note: Some

Of course this is the poor man's way of doing things as it is tedious and takes a lot of time.

But now that my first niche site has started bringing in some good mullah, I hope I will result to just buying deleted domain names from the different marketplaces that are available for the same.

What to Look for When Buying an Expired Domain Name

~ I usually like to get domain names which have links from high authority websites. In fact, this is the only thing that matters to me. I do not go for DA/PA TF/CF.

These metrics can be hugely deceptive. For instance, most of my niche site domain names for which I have used this strategy usually peak in DA within a few months, even when I have not built backlinks to them. My best has a DA of 40, and it is not even one year old.

If an expired domain name has links from the likes of BBC and HuffPost, I buy it.

~ Make sure that the domain name had not been used by spammers. If you checked that the domain name had links from authoritative sources, there's a chance that it does not contain as many spam links.

But even if it does, I feel that the powerful links from the authoritative websites kind of neutralizes the spam effect. That's exactly what happened with the domain name I picked for my first niche site. I think it got hacked somewhere in the course of its life. The hackers added payday content to a section of the website and built massive GSA links to the same.

Aren't you afraid that Google will penalize your blog for that? I have to admit it, this is somehow a risky move... but I still feel confident with it, largely because if my website got hit with a penalty, it will just be a matter of removing the redirect, and we will once again be in good standing.

It beats buying PBN or GSA links for your niche website.

Okay. Done with buying the domain name.

How do you actually make the redirect?
