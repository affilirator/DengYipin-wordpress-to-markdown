Three wheel baby strollers are becoming more and more common, and not just the jogging variety. What is known in the stroller industry as all-terrain models are being produced by just about every major manufacturer. The advantages of this design are many. They are often bigger, with a larger distance between the back wheels that creates a really stable base. But their single front wheel makes maneuvering much easier. The overall design makes these 3-wheelers well suited for off-road excursions as well as uneven sidewalks. Most have soft, air-filled tires that provide a comfortable ride for your passenger on a variety of surfaces and also make stroller much easier to push.

The stability, ease of steering, and comfort is appreciated even by those parents who don’t need a serious jogging stroller. These all-terrainers may look like joggers but you should check the user’s manual to see if it is advisable to actually use it for running with your baby. You should also check on the age requirements because most are not recommended for babies under six months old. Generally, pediatricians recommend that a baby can support its neck and sit up independently before using this type of stroller. There are exceptions to this guideline: the Maclaren MX3 is one of them. On the plus side, some all-terrain strollers can accommodate heavier children than standard strollers, allowing you to use them for a longer duration.

Some disadvantages of all-terrain models is that they are often large and heavy, making them an impractical choice for traveling. Another downer is that the air-filled tires can go flat so you’ll need a bicycle pump. But if you’re the rugged outdoorsy type that is drawn to this type of stroller, your probably have a bike pump already.

3-wheel (a.k.a. all-terrain) strollers range in price from $80 to more than $700.
