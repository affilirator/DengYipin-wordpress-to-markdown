Jeffrey Goldberg picked up his infant son, Isaac, caught his little arm in his sleeve and proceeded to bend it backward slightly. Oops. Isaac screamed, of course, but also bounced back in a hurry. "I still feel bad about that, but he was fine," says Goldberg, 30, of Framingham, Mass. "Babies are pretty tough little things – they're amazingly resilient."

At least Goldberg didn't drop Isaac, which is something he's feared doing since his baby boy was born in March. Yet it's a fear he shares with many other new dads, not to mention concerns about how to dress, soothe, support financially, feed and care for a new baby.

New moms haven't entirely cornered the market on newborn fears. Dads are worrywarts, too. And though many fears – such as, "Is the baby still breathing?" – are shared by Mom and Dad, new fathers have a set of concerns about their new babies all their own.

"Society has changed in a way that encourages fathers to take an active role \[in] all aspects of parenting," says Dennis DeWitt, a father of two and a health educator who teaches "Toolkits for Dads-to-be," a class offered at Kaiser Permanente in Portland, Ore.

"How do new fathers fill these roles with no experience and no model?" says DeWitt. "The result is insecurity, which leads to fear. New dads want to participate and get involved; they just do not know how."

She Won't Break! "It is common men are afraid babies will break," says Greg Bishop of Irvine, Calif., founder and head coach of Boot Camp for New Dads, a one-shot, three-hour program held at roughly 200 sites nationwide to help new and expectant fathers face and get over their newborn fears. But it takes holding an actual tiny, helpless, utterly dependent, squirmy newborn before a father can surmount his fears, he says.

Many new dads, like Goldberg, are handling a baby for the first time, so they have no experience to fall back on. "I've never had to care for a baby before, so even things like diapers and baths were pretty new to me," says Goldberg. "Not that any of those things are that hard."

Even Aaron Coe, a new father in Bellevue, Wash., had fears of his own, despite having observed plenty of fathers on the job. "My confidence comes from having seen many others around me cope with the challenges, and we always had a steady channel of books and Internet-based information to help with the academic side of newborn life," says Coe, who was caught off guard when his daughter, Eliana, came nearly three weeks early.

"Oddly, I fear my own mortality much more," says Coe, referring both to wanting to be around for every one of Eliana's life stages, as well as to his assumed role as his child's bank. "I think it is partially due to the notion of fiscal preparedness for her future."

Money Matters Fear about financial security also is high on dads' list of things to worry about, according to experts like Dr. André Stein, psychotherapist, a father of five and author of Father's Milk: Nourishment and Wisdom for the First-time Father.

Stein says new dads often assess, for the first time, their mortality and in so doing, are hit with the notion they are solely financially responsible for this new child for the next 18 to 21 years.

It's a prospect, Stein says, that undoes some fathers. Not only are they reflecting on their own fathers as lone breadwinners, but new dads also are considering the double-edged sword of working longer hours and spending less time out with the guys: both eat into their sense of independence, yet also may net them more money.

While the expectant and new moms expend worry energy on how to give birth and becoming – in many families – their child's sole source of nourishment, dads are fretting over the green stuff, says Bishop.

However, not all new fathers place money high on their worry list. "I did not want to be a 'breadwinner' father," says Clive Nisse, 33, of San Francisco, Calif. Instead, Nisse, father to a 14-month-old and general manager at the Noe Valley Bakery and Bread Company, put pressure on himself to be "the best dad in the world and give my child 120 percent."

Realizing once his daughter, Nadine, was born that perfection is an impossible goal, Nisse says, "I wanted to play a very active role in raising my child. I'll settle on being the best dad for my daughter." Nisse has no qualms about parenting his baby girl, but some dads approach their new title with uncertainty and trepidation.

Making a Connection Mike Vander Wel, a Seattle father of 4-year-old Anneka and 2 1/2-year-old Marcus, says once his daughter was born he felt uncertain about how to relate to her, a conflict he didn't experience when his second child was on the way. "I had no clue what to do," he says. "I remember the day we brought her home and thinking things like 'Who is this?' (and) 'Do we roll out the toys, and she goes for it or what?' I have grown to absolutely adore Anneka and love having a daughter. I don't think I was good at it at first. I've had some fears about how one plays with little girls, but Anneka has trained me."

Many new dads, like Vander Wel, fear they will be unable to make a connection with their child similar to that of the mother, says Deborah Phillips, author, parenting coach and creator of Coach-Parenting, dedicated to helping parents be the kind of parents they want to be.

"Many dads feel that their wives have had a connection with their baby for nine months, and they are coming in late," she says. "Many dads find it helpful to hear from their wives that they are just figuring it all out too."

And not just from their wives, but from other dads – both experienced and novice – too, say Bishop and Stein.

Finding Support According to Stein, new moms have "hundreds of thousands of books" at their disposal, whereas dads do not. He feels that women also are very good at forming groups with other new mothers whose experiences mirror their own to talk, talk, talk. Men, on the other hand, "are not in the habit of sitting down and sharing a beer and talking about parenting," says Stein, who lives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Yet the best strategy new dads can employ to work through their newborn fears is to copy the moms: Get with others like you. Take a class or participate in a program, and make an effort to meet men also doing the dad thing for the first time. "A little bit of encouragement goes a long way," says Bishop. "These days, it's the most wonderful time ever to be a father."

In fact, the number of households nationwide with an at-home dad increased by 70 percent from one million in 1990 to 1.7 million in 2000, according to Julie Shields' new book How to Avoid the Mommy Trap. And dads more involved with childcare and household chores have happier marriages, more sex, better health, more successful careers and are less likely to divorce.

Fortunately for new dads, they tend to be as emotionally resilient as their babies are physically. Most fathers quickly get into their new role, get excited about it and spend less time than the mommies sweating the small stuff.

"Just so long as the baby's happy, I'm good," says Goldberg. "I'm gonna screw stuff up along the way, but I think, just so long as I love him, help him when he needs it, let him figure some things out on his own, and just generally be there for him, I hope, I think, I believe that everything will work out fine."
