I got this question from one of my subscribers and decided to do a very short but comprehensive post about it.

> [Skrill](https://mahinge.com/visit/skrill "Skrill") vs[ Paypal ](http://www.paypal.com/ "Paypal")vs [Payoneer](https://mahinge.com/visit/payoneer "Payoneer"), which is the best payment gateway to use in Kenya?

Although [I had written a similar post a few weeks ago](https://mahinge.com/best-way-to-withdraw-money-paypal-kenya/ "get paid online in Kenya"), I thought that it wouldn't hurt to do a one-on-one comparison between the major online payment gateways that one can use in Kenya.

I personally use all of them because I believe each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. I use Payoneer to receive money from the sale of my [Kindle ebooks](https://mahinge.com/exclusive-report-90k-90-days/ "90K in 90 Days"). I use PayPal to receive payments from clients that I work with one-on-one and I use Skrill to withdraw money from Elance and oDesk.

Here is a breakdown of the pros and cons of each one of the payment gateways:

## Withdrawing to a Bank Account Charges

All three Payment gateways allow you to withdraw your money to a bank account here in Kenya.

[PayPal works with Equity Bank](https://mahinge.com/best-way-to-withdraw-money-paypal-kenya/ "PayPal Equity Bank") and the withdraw takes 8 days to complete. Their dollar exchange rate is one of the best in Kenya and their charges are an insignificant 1.5%. If you are not in a rush to get hands on your money, I would recommend you get an Equity Bank account, link your ATM card with PayPal and use the Equity-PayPal Gateway to withdraw money from PayPal.

If you are using other Kenyan banks and you have your funds in Paypal, you will have to first send your money to Payoneer in order to access it through a bank in Kenya, which brings me to the next payment gateway analysis.

What does it cost and how long does it take to withdraw money from Payoneer to your Kenyan bank account?

It usually takes up to two business days for money you have received on Payoneer to be available for withdrawal through an ATM. **You get charged 1% when you receive money through the account and \$2.15 when you make the withdrawal through a bank ATM**.

Of all the various withdrawal methods available, I find Payoneer to be very convenient. If you have not yet signed for a Payoneer account, click on the button below to do it now. You will receive $25 free when you sign up through the link and your accumulative withdrawals have reached $100.

Skrill charges 1% to withdraw money to your Kenyan bank account. But what really makes Skrill a game-changer is the fact that you can withdraw your money from Skrill to your Mpesa in a matter of minutes.
