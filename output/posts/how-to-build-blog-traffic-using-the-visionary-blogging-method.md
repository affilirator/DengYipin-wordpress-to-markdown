**Want better blog traffic? **Here’s how to use the five-step Visionary Blogging method to build your blog traffic and get better results. (For one-on-one help, check out my blog improvement services.)

## **Step 1: Increase Your Awareness**

How much do you know about improving blog traffic?

**You can’t improve what you don’t measure, and you can’t measure what you don’t see.**

So your first task is to become more aware of the subject of blog traffic building.

[Google the topic](https://www.google.com/search?q=blog+traffic). Talk to people who know how to increase blog traffic. Scour social media sites like [del.icio.us](https://del.icio.us/search/?fr=del_icio_us&p=blog+traffic&type=all), [Digg](https://web.archive.org/web/20080531012515/http://digg.com/search?s=blog+traffic&submit=Search&section=all&type=both&area=promoted&sort=most) and [StumbleUpon](https://www.stumbleupon.com/tag/blog+traffic/). Devote some time to research.

The greater your awareness, the better your ability to drive traffic to your blog.

## **Step 2: Sharpen Your Focus**

Why did I use the word “build” in the title of this article?

Because **building requires long-term vision**. You have to decide what you want the result to look like before you start to produce it.

If the question were, “What’s the _easiest_ way to _get_ more website traffic?” I’d smirk and suggest that you insert the names of a few female pop celebrities into your article headlines.

But who would come? How long would they stay? What would they do? How often would they return?

**Numbers mean nothing by themselves. **They become meaningful only as you make them represent individuals like you and me.

**In other words, don’t just seek _more_ traffic. Seek more of the _right kind_ of traffic.**

The right kind of traffic is the kind that will do what you want it to do. It’s the kind that will directly satisfy your online goals.

So it’s time to sharpen your focus. Decide exactly who your ideal blog visitor is (e.g. a [thirtysomething geek named Kip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Dynamite#Characters) who lives in his grandma’s trailer home in Kajiado, hogging her dial-up Internet connection and frequenting online dating apps) and what you want him or her to do (Buy your product? Subscribe to your feed? Click on an ad? All of the above?).

The sharper your focus, the better your ability to drive the right kind of traffic to your blog and convert it into positive results for your business.

## **Step 3: Hone Your Discernment**

Awareness and focus are great. They help you learn how to get people to your blog, identify who you want to visit your blog and decide what you want them to do once they get there.

**But without discernment, you’ll eventually fall short.**

You must be able to discern clearly between the blog traffic generation methods that work well for your blog and the ones that don’t.

So get and use excellent blog traffic monitoring tools like [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/blog/), [Google Analytics ](https://www.google.com/analytics/)and [CrazyEgg](https://crazyegg.com/) (to name a few). Check them once a day for a minute or two. Take some extra time once a week to dig deep into your blog traffic stats and evaluate what you are doing and how well it is working.

Pay close attention to your decision-making process. Why do you come to the conclusions that you do? Think about your logical processes and resolve to make smarter traffic-building choices. Write down your results and thoughts and plans continually.

The more honed your discernment, the better your ability to decide which methods of blog traffic generation to use and when.

## **Step 4: Excite Your Imagination**

The first three steps of the Visionary Blogging method are somewhat nuts-and-boltsy. You need them in order to get your blog traffic off the ground.

The fourth is anything _but_. And it can make your blog traffic soar.

It’s time to galvanize that dusty, rusty imagination of yours.

Every week when you sit down to evaluate your blog traffic progress and devise new traffic-building plans, take a few minutes to let your mind run wild.

Go nuts.

Picture a billion visits to your site - what would make that happen?

Picture 50 absolutely perfect blog visitors going crazy on your site - buying stuff left and right, leaving comments by the boatload, running through their virtual and real neighborhoods screaming your name and URL in ecstasy. What would make them do that?

### **Isn’t imagination fun?**

There is no such thing is a lack of traffic-building opportunities … only a lack of traffic-building vision.

Where you cannot see opportunities, it’s time to create your own.

There’s more [lateral thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_thinking) to supercharged blog traffic generation than you might, er, imagine.

So be creative. Create. Use your imagination.

The more excited your imagination, the better your ability to create new ways to build your blog’s traffic.

## **Step 5: Strengthen Your Diligence**

By now you’ve become a more aware, more focused, more discerning, more imaginative traffic-building blogger. Way to go!

But all that effort can make you tired. (If it doesn’t, you might not be trying hard enough.)

That’s where the fifth and final step comes in.

When the blogging gets tough, the tough blogger kicks it into fifth gear.

### **It’s diligence time, baby.**

Don’t give up. Don’t stop. Pause for a moment when you need to catch your breath, but then get right back up and keep hiking toward the summit.

Don’t get complacent. Don’t get jaded. Don’t get crusty. Don’t start thinking that there’s nothing else you can do to increase your blog traffic or make it boost your bottom line more effectively.

Every week in your blog traffic evaluation/planning, take a few minutes to review your own diligence. How hard did you work? How little time did you waste? What could you have done better to build your blog traffic?

Write down the answers to those questions. Insist on the routine. Make some goals and write them down too. Don’t lose sight of your goals.

**And work, work, work like a [mule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule#Characteristics).**

A good motto: “I will work harder and smarter to build my blog traffic this week than I did last week.”

The stronger your diligence, the better your ability to endure the natural fickleness of blog traffic and develop a long-term strategy for smart blog traffic building.

## **Conclusion**

As you apply the five steps of the Visionary Blogging method to your blog traffic building efforts, **you will enjoy an increase** in the right kind of traffic to your blog and those visitors will do more of what you want them to do.

**Please, please try it.** It’s not easy, but it’s pretty simple.

**Just take a minute** right now to decide when you’re gonna do something about this article - preferably today or tomorrow sometime. **Set 30 minutes aside** for it in your calendar. Then, when you get to it, read this article carefully and decide what to work on first (awareness, focus, discernment, imagination or diligence).

Finally, work a few minutes into your weekly blog planning sessions where you consider your blog traffic from the Visionary Blogging angle.

Do it. DO IT. Do it.

**May you never again wonder how to build blog traffic.** And may you get gobs of it, from the right people, over and over, and may it turn a great profit for you in the long run.
