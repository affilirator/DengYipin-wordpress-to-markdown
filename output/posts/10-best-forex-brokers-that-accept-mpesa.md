If you've not yet heard about FxPesa, they were the first forex broker to comply with Capital Markets Authority (CMA) regulations in 2019. They were consequently licensed by CMA to offer forex broker services in the country.

FxPesa offers two types of trading accounts:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

-

- <!-- /wp:list-item -->

Between the two trading accounts, the Premier Account offers the best trading conditions. It is an ECN account, which means that your orders are passed directly to liquidity providers.

### 2. XM Forex - Forex Broker With Huge Deposit Bonus

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":680} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

XM Forex is our all-time favorite forex broker that accepts Mpesa in Kenya. For starters, the account opening process at XM Forex is much easier than you’d find with other offshore brokers.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Our in-house forex traders and account managers have personally been trading with XM Forex for the past 7+ years, way before the broker even started accepting Mpesa.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

XM Forex has over 10 years in the industry, having been established in **2009**. The forex broker is fully licensed regulated in 4 jurisdictions namely:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"type":"lower-roman"} -->

1.  <!-- wp:list-item -->
2.  Australia
3.  <!-- /wp:list-item -->
4.
5.  <!-- wp:list-item -->
6.  Belize
7.  <!-- /wp:list-item -->
8.
9.  <!-- wp:list-item -->
10. Cyprus
11. <!-- /wp:list-item -->
12.
13. <!-- wp:list-item -->
14. Dubai
15. <!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Among all the licenses, the Australian license carries the heaviest weight. Not many forex brokers are able to obtain trading licenses in top-tier countries like Australia. The fact that XM Forex is licensed in Australia should boost your confidence when choosing to trade with them.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

To verify your account, you’ll only need to provide your identification document (National ID or passport). We recommend you use your Kenyan National ID to verify the account. When registering, make sure you provide the details indicated at the back of your ID as the address details.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->

#### Why Choose XM Forex in Kenya?

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->

- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- **Low Minimum Deposit**
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The minimum deposit at XM Forex is \$5 (about 500 Kenya Shillings). This low minimum deposit requirement allows anyone who’s interested in online forex trading to get started without risking a lot of money.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- **Huge bonuses on deposits**
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

For deposits upto $500, XM Forex offers 50% bonus. That means that funding your account with $100 makes it \$200. The deposit bonus offered by XM Forex is among the best bonuses in the industry, and we recommend that traders take advantage of it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Additionally, XM Forex does not charge any fee for depositing or withdrawing money from your trading account.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

### 2. HotForex - Best Regulated Forex Broker With Mpesa

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:block {"ref":680} /-->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

HotForex is an ECN/STP forex broker that has been in existence for the past 1o years (founded 2010). As an ECN/STP forex broker, HotForex is able to offer its clients some of the lowest spreads in the market, and that's why we recommend it as our #3 forex broker in Kenya.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

HotForex has many incredible features that we’re sure you will love. The broker offers MT4 and MT5 trading platforms and allows for Mpesa fund transfers, which is very convenient for Kenyans.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

HotForex also provides its clients with one of the widest selections of trading instruments including shares of the Fortune 500 companies like Apple Inc., Microsoft, and Google.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Apart from CFDs, you can also trade commodities, currencies and indices. As a matter of fact, HotForex has the largest selection of CFDs from all forex brokers operating in Kenya!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

### 3. LiteFinance - Best ECN Forex Broker That Accepts Mpesa

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":812,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->

![best forex trading platforms in kenya](./images/wp-content-uploads-2021-05-trading-platforms-in-kenya.png)

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Formerly known as LiteForex, LiteFinance also makes it in the list of the best forex brokers in Kenya. LiteForex is the other broker that accepts Mpesa and makes the forex trading account opening process a bliss. Not only that, but this Mpesa Forex Broker also offers revolutionary trading features including a copy trading platform that lets you copy trades from the most successful traders on the platform.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Just to show you how innovative LiteForex has been, they were the first forex brokers to pioneer cent accounts, whose minimum deposit is as low as \$1.00.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mpesa deposits at LiteForex are free and instant. Withdrawals using Mpesa are also instant and incur a fee of 100 shillings only per withdrawal.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

LiteForex boosts over 15 years in the market, having been established in 2015.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->

#### Why Choose LiteForex in Kenya?

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->

- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- Forex Copy Trading
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

[Forex copy trading](https://kenyaforexfirm.co.ke/forex-social-trading/) is one of the most revolutionary forex trading systems of our time. With the copy trading system, you simply deposit money into your LiteForex trading account, choose a successful forex trader to follow/copy, and watch your profits roll in.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The copy trading system works on profit sharing basis. Mostly 70:30 where you get 70% of the profits earned from your capital while the strategy provider gets the other 30%. Considering that all you have to do is deposit money into your trading and watch the professional trader do the bulk of the work, I’d say a 70:30 profit share is something to smile about.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It is almost impossible to blow your account when using forex copy trading if you choose the right strategy provider to follow. Your money is also safe and you can withdraw it at any time as the money is held by the forex broker, not the strategy provider.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If you’re a professional and profitable forex trader, you can also earn extra income from copy trading by sharing your forex trading strategies to be copied. The process is easy and seamless.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### 9. Exness

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Exness is a forex and CFDs forex broker that offers an array of trading instruments and competitive spreads.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The company is registered in Cyprus with registration number HE346535, license obtained on September 16th 2015 as a CySEC regulated broker, providing financial services to retail clients through its website. The group was founded by Vladimir Ribakov who has been involved in the industry for more than 20 years now.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Who'd have thought that a Russian-based forex broker would feature in our list of the top forex brokers that accept Mpesa in Kenya... But wonders never cease, and it is what it is.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A Russian forex broker, FreshForex (or Fresh Forest, as some people call it) caps the list of our top 10 best forex brokers with Mpesa.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

However, instead of the automatic Mpesa payments that we are have so far seen with other forex brokers, FreshForex uses local agents (introducing brokers) to facilitate the deposits.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

FreshForex is suited more for beginners and those who are on their first steps in the forex trading journey. The broker offers many incredible bonuses that will help the rooking forex trader become familiar with forex trading.
