> ### If you could pick any person in the world to be your mentor, who would you pick?

Just imagine what it would be like to have access to the personal wisdom, insight, and guidance of someone like Oprah, Arianna Huffington or Sonia Sotomayor. It would be like gaining a lifetime of experience in achievement and success.

But getting mentors of this caliber would be impossible, or would it?

What if I told you, you could enjoy all of the benefits of having a world-class mentor without ever actually knowing them? What if I told you, you could have a world-class mentor – in your mind?

What if I told you how you can create a mental mentor? Well, I’m going to.

## What is a Mental Mentor?

A mental mentor is a person you seek out for motivation, inspiration, and guidance with one BIG exception. You don’t actually know them.

In fact, you might never be able to physically meet them (because in all likelihood they’re far beyond your network or may have even passed away). But just as with a real-life mentor you benefit from the wisdom you acquire from them.

The benefits of having a mental mentor lie in the ability to call upon the insights you’ve gathered through your intense study of your mental mentor’s character, personality, and life achievements.

By dedicating time to reading your mental mentor’s biographies, autobiographies, speeches, and articles you acquire valuable material about their character traits, actions, and success strategies that you can apply toward achieving your own aspirations. It may sound a little kooky, but believe me, it works.

I have a mental mentor. Mary Kay Ash. I’ve never met Mary Kay, she passed away in 2001, but I’ve just finished reading every book she’s ever written. And after having studied the essence of who she was through her books, I feel an intuitive knowing of Mary Kay Ash. Surely she was one of the worlds greatest female entrepreneurs.

I feel privileged to have read her work and to take as my own the principles she used to guide her life and entrepreneurial success.

## 5 Tenets of Wisdom Every Online Entrepreneur Should Know

The following are five instrumental nuggets of wisdom that I discovered in my study of Mary Kay. Take them and make them your own.

Every online entrepreneur with a dream in their heart should apply them to their own entrepreneurial journey.

### **1. Be a “go-giver.”**

Based on upon the golden rule, Mary Kay Ash believed that success in business required focusing on giving not getting.

She believed that you couldn’t reach your maximum potential with your clients and customers if you merely had dollar signs in your eyes. In other words, always ask yourself “what can you do for your clients to leave them better off than they were before they found you, your business, and your services?”

### **2. Make a “\$100,000” list**

In Mary Kay’s day she called it a $35,000 dollar list, but taking inflation into account, these days we need a $100,000 list!

The \$100,000 list is a concept stems from an incident where Charles Schwab sought advice from an efficiency expert, Ivy Lee.

Mr. Lee told Mr. Schwab to increase productivity by writing down his six most important tasks each day and rank them by priority. Mr. Lee told Schwab to cross each task off this list as completed, and whatever wasn’t finished was transferred to the list for the following day.

When Mr. Schwab asked how much Mr.Lee‘s advice would cost him, Mr. Lee replied “Whatever you think it’s worth to you.” Mr. Schwab wrote him a check for \$35,000, and that was in the 1920s.

Make your \$100,000 list today. Write down – on paper – the six most important things you have to, and go do it. You achieve when you take action.

### **3. Believe “you CAN do it.”**

Mary Kay Ash grew up having more responsibility than the average girl. As a result, her mother frequently encouraged her to do things that challenged her. Mary was fortunate to have a mother who instilled a can-do mentality in her. This spirited shaped the growth of Mary Kay Cosmetics and became the company’s motto.

Mary Kay believed that women in particular have exceeding amounts of untapped potential, and that developing an extraordinary self-confidence could fully develop that potential.

To symbolize this “you can do it” spirit, Mary Kay Cosmetics distributes diamond bumblebee pins to their top performers.

_Why a bumblebee?_

Because according to the laws of aerodynamics, a bumblebee shouldn’t be able to fly. But it does. With wings too weak for its body weight, and a body too heavy for flight, a bumblebee should never get off the ground. But it does!

### **4. Develop extraordinary determination**

As Mary Kay saw it, the only difference between successful people and unsuccessful people is their bull-dogged determination to see their dreams come to pass.

_So how can you develop this type of determination?_

First, you must have a spirit to win. You must have a burning desire to reach your goal.

Second, you must have knowledge. When you have knowledge, you have confidence, and when you’re confident you exude enthusiasm. Those are characteristics that attract success.

Third, you must take action. Unless you are taking steps towards turning your dream into a reality, it will only ever be a dream. Become a doer and watch your life take shape.

### **5. Maintain a proper perspective.**

For Mary Kay Ash the proper perspective for her life was God first, family second, and career third. Mary Kay knew what she needed to live a balanced life and always kept her life priorities in order.

You cannot build a successful business and neglect your family. You cannot live a fulfilled life and ignore your spirit. You cannot fail to take care of yourself and build a flourishing career. The way you do one thing in life is the way you will do all things in life. Strive to strike a balance and watch your personal and professional life blossom.

There a many more lessons the late great Mary Kay Ash shares in her wisdom-filled books [_Miracles Happen_](http://amzn.to/2gdiptI) and [_You Can Have It All: Lifetime Wisdom from America’s Foremost Woman Entrepreneur_](http://amzn.to/2eBKtXv). However, I found these five principles to be the most imperative.

Are you an online entrepreneur wanting to take the world by storm? You can do it! Go give all that you have to offer. Handle your most important responsibilities first. Live a balanced life. And…never ever give-up.
