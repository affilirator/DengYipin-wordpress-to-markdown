Today I started reworking on a project that has remained dear to my life since I launched it late last year.

I have a dream to create the next big **online courses directory** in Kenya. Most of the courses have a focus on webpreneurship, which is a subject that I hold very dear. I have previously sold courses on my main website, but I didn't like the fact that most of the courses were not interactive.

My goal is to create a platform that goes beyond merely selling online courses. My goal is to create a platform that allows for interaction among all the participants. This way, we can manage to grow online work in Kenya to greater heights.

My goal is to have a platform where everyone is a teacher and a student at the same time. The platform will allow everyone who has a skill that they would like to share to sell it here.

You can become a teacher.
