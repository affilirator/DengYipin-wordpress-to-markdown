> Which is the best hosting for my Amazon niche site?

This is an age-old question that unfortunately never gets answered _truthfully_.

Most of the reviews for the _best web hosting services_ are swayed by the amount of commission that a web hosting company is willing to offer affiliates to promote them.

Others are driven by populist guru opinions that are not backed by real data/tests of the hosting services being recommended.

Most of us have been suckered into blindly following our mentors where they host their websites. I have been in the same boat for a while too until I decided to do things my own way.

If you are a member of Amazon affiliate marketing groups on Facebook, your hosting journey might be looking something like this:

1.  **Year 1**: Hosting with some [crappy EIG web host](https://www.reviewhell.com/blog/endurance-international-group-eig-hosting/) that oversells their services and whose support really sucks
2.  **Year 2**: Moved to Siteground WordPress Hosting because I heard it's all the rage nowadays
3.  **Year 3**: This guy who says he makes \$xxx,xxx per month with his Amazon niche sites just said that he moved his websites over to WPXHosting. It's time to move. Sorry Siteground :-(
4.  **Year 4**: Ahh! We just discovered Cloudways. And, apparently, nothing we have tested previously beats what they have to offer. That's what our mentor said. Let's kiss goodbye to WPXHosting.
5.  **Year 5 (2019)**: You just came full circle with the same question. What's the best hosting for my Amazon Affiliate site?

Please Note: I am not saying that any of the hosting services mentioned above is bad (This site is actually still hosted on WPX and we're doing just fine). But as human beings, we have an unquenchable thirst for the very best.

That's why in this piece, I am going to share what I think to be the very best web hosting for your Amazon niche site. I'll not only tell you what's the best but also share with you the criteria that you should use to vet a service before you jump onboard.

If you do this right, you might never need to move your site to any other hosting provider, ever.

## Understanding Hosting/Server Types

Before you can get to the point you decide what hosting to go with, it's very important to understand what type of servers you'll have to choose from.

They are 4 common server types to choose from:

### 1. Shared Server Hosting

One box (think of it as the CPU of your PC) runs hundreds of websites. The performance of your site depends on the load that the other websites are putting on the server. Both SiteGround and WPXHosting are examples of shared server hosting.

There are both advantages and disadvantages of going the shared hosting way.

#### Advantages

Most people quote price, support, and easy installations as the main reason for choosing a shared hosting service such as Siteground. Later in this article, I'll tell you why my recommended hosting makes these advantages obsolete, especially now that we are in 2019.

#### Disadvantages

Shared hosting puts a lot of limits on what you can do with the server. Some restrictions that I can think of the tip of my fingers include:

- Limits on the number of websites/domains/databases you can host on your account. You'd have to subscribe to a higher price plan if you go past the imposed limits
- Caps on server resources such as CPU memory

### 2. VPS (Virtual Private Server)

A virtual private server (or simply a VPS) is the next tier as you're moving up from a shared host. A VPS is a server within a server.

If we were to extend the personal computer analogy, you might think of a VPS as an independent disk partition/folder with its own operating system and server resources. Got it? One big server divided into many autonomous servers using a process we call virtualization.

For many years, it used to be that VPS was recommended for people who felt they had outgrown shared hosting. The main advantage that a VPS offers over shared hosting is that you do not get to share your server resources with other people on the server.

### 3. Dedicated Bare Metal Server Hosting

If you want complete autonomy for your site, a dedicated server would be the way to go (if we already weren't in 2019). Think of a dedicated server as having the whole CPU to yourself.

Both a VPS and a dedicated server would be an okay recommendation for hosting an Amazon niche site... if we weren't in 2019. But we are in 2019, so, here's what I recommend to host your sites

### 4. Cloud Servers (What I recommend for Amazon Niche Sites or any other site for that matter)

Cloud servers are the best choice for hosting your Amazon niche site. A cloud server is a virtual server as opposed to a physical server.

It is built, hosted and delivered via a cloud computing platform via the internet, and can be accessed remotely. They are also known as virtual servers. Cloud servers have all the software they require to run and can function as independent units.

Remember when I told you I'll let you know why my recommended hosting beats Shared hosting (and all other types of hosting discussed above)? This is that moment.

#### Cost

Shared hosting used to be the most affordable hosting. Not anymore. You can spin a Cloud Instance on platforms such as Vultr and Hetzner for as low as \$2.50 per month.

If you're tech-savvy and know your way around Linux command lines and server management you can get a well-built server rolling with a fraction of the cost you pay for shared hosting from services such as Siteground or WPXHosting.

And what's more, your sites will run amazingly fast even on the very bare minimum server options offered by Cloud hosting platforms such as Vultr or Hetzner.

#### Ease of Use

Let's be honest. A cloud server is basically a VPS albeit one that is virtual (lives in the cloud). And we all know virtual private servers are not the easiest to operate when you don't have some advanced Linux tips and tricks.

So, how can a cloud server be easier to use than the good ol' and trusted CPanel installed with Softaculous or Fantastico?

As I said, it is 2019 and technology is ever evolving. Someone said that necessity is the mother of invention. Cloud hosting used to be a preserve of command line geeks but it was only a matter of time before inventive entrepreneurs found a way to make the Cloud manageable to each one of us.

The following services connect with your cloud server instance to make managing it a walk in the park:

1.  **ServerPilot**
2.  **RunCloud**
3.  **CloudWays**
4.  Trellis
5.  YunoHost
6.  CloudRon
7.  PageFog
8.  Moss.sh
9.  VestaCP
10. EasyEngine
11. Forge.Laravel.Com

All 3 provide an easier web-based platform that allows you to launch fully secured Amazon Niche sites built on WordPress.
