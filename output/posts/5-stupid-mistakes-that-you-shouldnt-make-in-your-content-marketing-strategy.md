I recently had a talk with one of the top business entrepreneurs that I revere the most here in Kenya; a talk that left me feeling that many Kenyan business persons are still to understand what **content marketing** really entails.

According to my friend’s understanding, content marketing only stretches as far as starting a blog for their company and filling it with Keyword and SEO-rich articles!

Never have I heard the idea of content marketing so underestimated.

Anyways, as I love writing, I decided that the best way to educate the online entrepreneurs in Nairobi, Kisumu or Mombasa is to chuck this piece out as I try to answer the frequently asked questions about content marketing:

## **_What is Content Marketing_**

This is probably one of those questions that have been asked time and again but still deserves a mention. To understand content marketing, you must first of all understand content.

Content in the internet marketing kind of talk can either be

1.  **text**- (blog posts, Facebook updates, white papers, ebooks)
2.  **images** (infographics, memes)
3.  **audio** (podcasts)
4.  **video**

Content Marketing uses these four items to promote a brand in a non-promotional manner.

The main aim of content marketing is to educate the audience about a particular product without the slightest hint of the salesman’s language.

## **_Who are content marketers_**

Not every businessperson can manage or have the time to create captivating videos, podcasts, infographics, blog posts or whitepapers (that’s part of the commonly used content in content marketing). This is where the content marketers come in. content marketers are highly knowledgeable in a particular field out of the four we mentioned.

Most of the time, the team of content marketers will comprise of fellows who are talented in various fields. They will record/create videos and post them in Youtube.

They will create social media updates and they will write and distribute whitepapers and press releases for business entrepreneurs.
