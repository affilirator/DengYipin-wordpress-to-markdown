![Fx pesa reviews](./images/wp-content-uploads-2022-03-fx-pesa-reviews-1-1024x512.jpg)

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There are 2 types of FxPesa trading accounts, and the minimum deposit required varies depending on the type of account. For example, the minimum deposit for an Executive account is $5, while the minimum deposit for a Premier account is $100. To find out more information about the different types of accounts and their respective minimum deposits, please visit [FxPesa's website](https://mahinge.com/loves/fxpesa-2/).

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When looking for a forex broker, one of the most important factors to consider is the minimum deposit required to open an account. This seems like a fair and straightforward requirement, but it can be deceptive.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When a forex broker advertises that they have a "minimum deposit" of \$5, they're not telling the whole story. The minimum deposit is just the amount you need to open an account with the broker. However, in order to be successful in forex trading, a person needs to have a lot of money at their disposal so that they can make trades on margin and reap larger profits.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So, although the minimum deposit at FxPesa lies at \$5, we don't recommend you start trading with such a low amount.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

## FxPesa Spreads & Fees

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

FxPesa is a good broker, but their spreads on the Executive account are not ideal. They tend to be on the high side, which can make it difficult to make a profit on your trades.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->

> The spreads offered by FXPesa are not ideal, especially when compared to some of the other CMA licensed forex brokers.

<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

For example, Pepperstone offers starting spreads as low as 0.6 pips on the EUR/USD pair, while FXPesa starts at 1.4 pips. This can make a big difference in terms of profitability, especially for traders who are looking to scalp or trade frequently. Other forex brokers such as XM Forex and HotForex also have much lower spreads compared to FxPesa.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Of course, FxPesa has many other features that make it attractive to beginner forex traders, so it really depends on what you're looking for in a broker.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

On the Premier Account, FxPesa charges a commission of \$7 per round turn (buy and sell). The commission is charged on all forex pairs and precious metals.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:uagb/section {"classMigrate":true,"block_id":"f6919921","backgroundType":"color","backgroundColor":"#f9f1da"} -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A round turn is the purchase and sale of the same security or currency pair. For example, if you buy EUR/USD, then sell/close EUR/USD, that would be a round turn.
