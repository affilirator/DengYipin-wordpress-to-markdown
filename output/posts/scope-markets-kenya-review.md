## Account Types at Scope Markets

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Scope Markets (Kenya LTD) offers 2 account types, including:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->

1.  **Silver Account**: An account that charges raw spreads, and is most recommended for beginners
2.  **Gold Account**: Charges a combination of raw spreads and commissions

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A forex account that charges raw spreads is a great option for experienced traders who are comfortable making their own trading decisions. With a raw spread account, you only pay the spread (the difference between the buy and sell prices) on each transaction. This can be a more cost-effective option than traditional brokerage accounts, which charge commissions in addition to the spread.

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### Scope Markets Silver Account

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There are a few things you'll want to keep in mind if you're considering opening a forex account that charges raw spreads. Firstly, it's important to make sure that your broker offers competitive spreads on the currencies you plan to trade. Scope Markets has spreads starting at 1.1 pips on their Silver Accounts, which is slightly above the industry average of 0.6 pips on the EUR/USD.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### Scope Markets Gold Account

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The Scope Markets Gold Account is a commission-based account that charges $7.00 round turn (i.e $7.00 on every \$100,000 traded). This is the industry average for commission-based accounts.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A commission-based forex account can be a good option for experienced traders who are comfortable with taking on more risk in order to potentially earn higher profits. These accounts typically charge a commission on each trade, which can eat into profits over time. However, they also offer traders more freedom to choose the trades they make and may offer a wider range of investment options.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

## Scope Markets Minimum Deposit

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Scope Markets minimum deposit requirement is 100 USD. This amount is required to open a standard account at the company. The 100 USD minimum deposit requirement is lower than that of many other forex brokers, making it a good option for first-time traders.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When considering a Forex broker, it's important to look at more than just the minimum deposit requirement. Make sure you also compare the spreads, commissions, and other fees charged by different brokers. And be sure to [read reviews of different brokers](https://mahinge.com/best-forex-brokers-with-mpesa-deposits/) before opening an account, so you can choose one that has a good reputation and meets your needs.
