Don’t you just wish that you can have one multi-functioning kitchen appliance that could substitute a significant number of kitchen appliances? With **Blendtec blenders**, you can just about replace nine appliances from your kitchen. With their 1500 watt motor, they will mix, blend, chop, knead and puree almost anything in the kitchen.

#### Plus Point #1: Great Usability

A Blendte blenders is a valuable addition to any modern kitchen. It will cut off prep time of whatever you are making; crush ice for a creamy milkshake or puree some asparagus for a hot healthy soup within seconds.

You can even make your Blendtec blender knead your bread dough into perfection! Plus, according to the manual, you can even make your own peanut butter spread. I MUST try one of these days!

Although the blades itself is not enough to do the work due to its dullness, team it up with the rotation from the motor, you will get a destructive (sort of) machine. The blades also come with a lifetime warranty, in case you ever need it.

#### This May Prove A Disadvantage

I will not lie. The only thing that is not appealing about the Blendtec blenders is that they cost a bomb. A blender that costs \$400 or more is definitely a turn-off for most. However, it will be a great investment considering if you use it on an everyday basis. Below are some of my recommendations:
