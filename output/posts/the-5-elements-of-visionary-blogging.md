## **What is visionary blogging?**

Visionary blogging is blogging with vision.

### **What is vision?**

**Vision consists of 5 elements:**

1.  **Awareness -** the ability to see.
2.  **Focus **- the ability to look.
3.  **Discernment** - the ability to evaluate.
4.  **Imagination** - the ability to create.
5.  **Diligence **- the ability to endure.

Vision is not money, power or success - but it will help you become richer, more powerful and more successful.

In fact, you _must_ improve your vision in order to achieve maximum blogging and professional success.

**Without vision, you damn yourself to blogging hell.**

You kill your ability to improve and progress. You shut off and shut out the light.

As you learn about and hone your visionary blogging skills - your powers of awareness, focus, discernment, imagination, and diligence - your blog will improve and you will become a better blogger. And that improvement will come faster and more naturally than ever.

Using the Visionary Blogging method, you can improve your blogging vision and reach your ultimate potential as a blogger and professional.

## Step #1: Increase Your Awareness

### **What is awareness?**

Awareness is the first element of visionary blogging and the first step to effective blog improvement.

Awareness is the ability to _see_ - the ability to detect, to perceive, to sense.

Awareness is consciousness.

Awareness is potential.

Awareness is [meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta).

### **How does your level of awareness affect your blog improvement potential?**

Without awareness, all is darkness and silence to you. Stuff still exists, but you cannot sense it.

What you aren’t aware of, you can’t see.

What you can’t see, you can’t measure.

What you can’t measure, you can’t improve.

So in order to improve your blog or yourself as a blogger, you must have awareness. You must be aware.

As you strive to become more aware and blog more consciously, you actually _improve your ability to improve_.

**Meta-improvement** - the improvement of improvement - is the greatest blogging skill of all and the capstone to the whole Visionary Blogging method. It brings everything full circle and generates an upward curve or spiral of ever-brightening awareness and self-improvement.

But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. The capstone comes last; first, we need to lay the foundation.

## Step #2: Focus

I’ll tell you what focus is, why you must have focus in order to become a visionary blogger, and how to sharpen your blogging focus.

### **What is Focus?**

**Focus is the ability to _look_.** It requires awareness (the ability to see) plus concentrated attention.

For example, you’re _aware_ of many things right now - the temperature of the air around you, the movement of objects in your peripheral vision, the need to call back that one guy about the thing, etc. - but your _focus_ is on these typed words. (I hope.)

Focus brings exactness and clarity to otherwise blurry blogging.

What do you look at when you are blogging? What commands your attention and what do you ignore?

### **How Focus Affects Blogger and Blog Improvement**

Without focus, wisdom is lost in knowledge and knowledge is lost in information. You see much but look at little. The Web becomes a trap instead of a treasure chest.

Focus enables you to dredge oceans of information, capture oysters of knowledge and extract pearls of wisdom in spite of danger, distraction or fatigue.

Focus aids [meta-improvement](https://www.lean.org/LeanPost/Posting.cfm?LeanPostId=950) by training your mind’s eye on the aspects of your blog or blogging that matter most to your success. It acts as a mental filter, whetting your appetite for superb blogging tips and screening out the irrelevant, the unimportant and the mediocre.

No wonder focus seems to contain [magical power](https://zenhabits.net/the-magical-power-of-focus/). Nothing else improves poor vision so quickly or drastically.

### **How to Sharpen Your Focus for Faster Blogger Self-Improvement**

Here are **3 simple yet challenging exercises** you can do to hone your focus and make yourself a better blogger. Try these or create your own assignments.

1.  **For one day, keep a detailed log** of your blog-related activities and their purposes. This can be a list on paper or in an electronic document. Be as thorough as possible in noting what you do, for how long and why. Afterward, evaluate your level of focus during the day. When was it strong? When was it weak? What factors influenced your ability to focus? What will you do to focus better tomorrow?
2.  **For 5 minutes, \*\***write all the things you can think of\*\* that you would love to accomplish through your blogging efforts. Then take 5-10 minutes to sort the accomplishments on your list in order of priority. What would be the most important thing you could accomplish? The next most important thing? The least important thing?
3.  **Take a few minutes to\*\*** create a list of activities\*\* that, while enjoyable, tend to prevent you from reaching your blogging goals. For each activity, decide how to make sure you do not waste any time on it. For example, [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/) can be a valuable networking and communication tool that adds to the success of a blog. But if you sometimes find yourself wandering too far down Twitterpated Lane and forsaking more urgent and important activities, consider setting a few personal rules to maximize your use of Twitter. e.g. no Twitter until I have cleared out my email inbox each day; no more than 30 minutes on Twitter; I will shut off Twitter when I’m not at work on blog-related things; etc.

**Your homework this time** is to do one or more of the above exercises within 2 days of the time you read this article and tell me how it went in a comment below. I will do it too. Let’s help each other improve our blogging focus.

## Step #3: Discernment

_Discernment is the ability to evaluate._ It requires awareness (the ability to see) and focus (the ability to look), the first two elements of the visionary blogger.

### **Why You Need Discernment In Order to Be a Successful Blogger**

Discernment enables you to compare things to each other and judge their true nature and value. It helps you tell whether someone has the [right to be called an expert](https://www.blogherald.com/2008/03/31/what-gives-you-the-right-to-tell-me/).

Without discernment, you cannot tell if a blog you’ve just discovered is real or fake. You cannot decide which blog post ideas are most worth writing about or which blogging activities deserve your attention.

In short, you need discernment in order to make wise blogging decisions.

### **The 6 “SUPER-D” Discernment Powers**

- **S**implify complex things
- **U**nderstand the nature of something
- **P**erceive character, thoughts and intentions
- **E**stimate value
- **R**ecognize difference
- **D**etermine truth

### ![Dinner Fork in Road](https://web.archive.org/web/20080625024701im_/http://www.visionaryblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/dinner-fork-in-road.jpg)**The Fork in the Road**

So you come upon a fork in the road.

No, not that kind of fork.

A fork where you must decide between two or more paths, neither of which leads straight ahead.

In other words, you have to change something about what you’re doing - but there are multiple options to choose from.

Bloggers get forks in their roads all the time.

For instance, you may have to choose between sticking to your original brand or rebranding for your evolving audience.

Or you may need to decide which T-shirt would look best on your blog readers.

Or you may have trouble just figuring out what to blog about.

Discernment shows you the best fork.

#### **How to Convert Information into Wisdom in 3 Steps Using Awareness, Focus and Discernment**

1.  **Awareness** floods you with information.
2.  **Focus** filters and converts some of that information into knowledge.
3.  **Discernment** evaluates that knowledge and transforms some of it into wisdom.

_Here's a Real-Life Blogging Example of How This Plays Out_

1.  **Awareness: **You open your favorite RSS feed reader to see hundreds of new blog posts and other items published in the last day. You quickly become aware that many people are discussing the new launch of [WordPress 5.0.3 and the Gutenberg Editor](https://wordpress.org/download/). You have access to information but do not yet possess knowledge on this subject.
2.  **Focus: **You decide to look for advice on whether to upgrade your blog to WordPress 5.0.3. You scan the feed item headlines and articles selectively, opening relevant items in new browser tabs and ignoring the rest. You take a few minutes to carefully read each article matching your focus. Now you have some knowledge about this topic and feel prepared enough to make a wise decision.
3.  **Discernment: **You make a list of the different opinions you find and spend a few minutes weighing what others have said about the pros and cons of upgrading to WP 5.0.3. You think about your past experiences upgrading your blog platform. You consider a variety of other factors and finally decide to go ahead and make the upgrade. You now possess some wisdom, or applied knowledge, on this subject; you have made an informed decision on what to do with the knowledge you have gleaned from the information you have encountered.

### **10 Ways to Improve Your Discernment and Become a More Powerful Blogger**

1.  ![Pondering Man](https://web.archive.org/web/20080625024701im_/http://www.visionaryblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/pondering-man.jpg)**Observe carefully. **Pay close attention to details. Pay _extra_ close attention to the blogs and people whose examples you want to follow. Hang onto their every pixel and word.
2.  **Experiment. **The only way to know if a seed will grow into a tree is to plant it. If it grows, it’s a good seed. If not, either it’s a bad seed or its growing conditions are too poor.Similarly, you should have the courage to try things out on your blog and in your blogging routine. If they work, keep doing them. If they don’t, stop and consider changing your approach or replacing your idea.
3.  **Imagine the future. **Think of the possibilities and probabilities involved. [Should your blog become a company](http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2008/02/22/how-to-decide-if-you-should-start-a-company/)? Depends in part on how many gray hairs or wrinkles you think that would give you.
4.  **Remember the past.** What to write about? Well, [what worked before](https://bloggingtips.com/2008/03/29/how-to-choose-which-blog-post-to-post/)? That’s one good approach.
5.  **Think about needs. **For instance, what does your blog’s [target audience need](https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/niche-selection-tips/)?
6.  **Gather things together.** It’s much easier to compare, say, possible blog niches if you’ve assembled a list of them in one spot.
7.  **Narrow your field.** Of vision, that is. Limit the options to make the right choice easier to discern. For example, instead of wondering which of a billion post ideas is best right now, you could force yourself to choose from among just three.
8.  **Ask for help. **Maybe someone in your blog audience, in your email contact list or in your apartment building has a better sense of discernment on a particular matter than you do. Maybe they’ve got access to a light source that you don’t. Or maybe they’re just positioned at a better angle.
9.  **Write everything down. **Well, not everything. But if you’re stuck in the discernment process, having a written collection of thoughts can help you begin to get clarity.
10. **Refresh your focus.** Sometimes you lack discernment [because you’re distracted](https://seths.blog/2008/03/before-you-buy/).

### **Remember, Pobody’s Nerfect**

Not every tactic in this article will work well for you. That’s part of the point here - you need to try to discern what to apply right now. The only one who can make up your mind is you.

You cannot expect to have perfect discernment in all areas of your life. You will make mistakes. But as you identify and learn from your mistakes, you will improve your ability to discern between good and bad choices, or between useful and useless knowledge. Discernment is the key to making better decisions in spite of human weakness.

## Step #4: Imagination

> _come with me and you’ll be_
>
> _in a world of pure imagination_
>
> _take a look and you’ll see_
>
> _into your imagination_

### **What is Imagination?**

Imagination is the ability to create.

To create means to make something new using existing material.

In particular, imagination is the power to create ideas.

Ideas are the currency of the attention economy.

[Valuable ideas rule](https://readwrite.com/2007/03/01/attention_economy_overview/).

Imagination is the key to discovering original solutions to our problems.

With rare exceptions, today’s most influential bloggers are masters of imagination.

They are master idea creators.

While the first three elements of visionary blogging (awareness, focus and discernment) must build upon each other, imagination stands alone.

> _we’ll begin with a spin_
>
> _trav’ling in the world of my creation_
>
> _what we’ll see will defy explanation_

You have the power to imagine - and therefore do - things that _defy explanation_.

I know you do.

### **How Imagination Boosts Your Blogging Success**

![Patrick Mahinge](./images/wp-content-uploads-2019-01-visionary-blogging.jpg)

With imagination’s power, you can do things never before done.

Your imaginative blogging [can make a difference](http://www.businessblogwire.com/2007/10/blog_make_difference.html) in this world.

Here are just a few ways in which imagination benefits your blogging:

1.  Imagination helps you learn faster**. **Creative thinking cements newfound blogging tips in the mind.
2.  **Imagination helps you understand people and situations better. **Ever wondered what it’s like to be in someone’s shoes?
3.  **Imagination fuels virality.** Often, it’s the main difference between a meme that spreads like wildfire and a meme that quickly turns to ashes.
4.  **Imagination makes ordinary blog content exciting. **It’s that sentence worded unexpectedly, that fresh angle, that astonishing assertion.
5.  **Imagination freshens stale blog design.** In perhaps no other characteristic of a blog is lameness so quickly detected or uniqueness so highly prized.
6.  **Imagination invigorates a weak blog community. **Your blog visitors, commenters and backlinkers all depend on you to give them creative conversation cues - give them what they want or they may stop conversing with or about you.
7.  **Imagination enables powerful [mind mapping](https://problogger.com/discover-hundreds-of-post-ideas-for-your-blog-with-mind-mapping/) and [blog planning](https://bloggingtips.com/2008/01/28/5-tips-to-create-a-blog-plan-for-long-term-success/). **You can’t reach goals you haven’t set, and you can’t publish articles you haven’t dreamed of yet.
8.  **Imagination makes you more interesting. **Others in your blogging solar system will take you more seriously even as they find you more fun, if only you have the courage to let your imagination shine.

Imagination makes you a better blogger.

Imagination makes your blog better.

> _if you want to view paradise_
>
> _simply look around and view it_
>
> _anything you want to, do it_
>
> _want to change the world, there’s nothing to it_

What can you see? What do you _want_ to see?

How much are you limiting your blog’s growth by stifling your imagination?

### **How to Improve Your Imagination: 14+ Ways**

**1. Approve.** It’s okay. Go ahead. Give yourself permission. Nobody’s watching. Don’t worry about embarrassing yourself.\*\*\*\*

**2. Exercise.** Take a few minutes each day or each week to do nothing but imagine stuff. No imaginary pain, no imaginary gain.

**3. Write it down.** Take notes as you daydream or imagine things. Wait until your imagination time ends if you’re concerned about breaking its flow. But once you’re done, write down what you’ve learned or experienced or thought.\*\*\*\*

**4. Start with anything.** Picture your blog if you like. Or picture a blue barracuda named Bob. It matters less where you begin than where you go.

**5. Change something. **So there’s Bob the barracuda in your brain. Now change something about him. Poof! His name’s Shirley. Poof! Give him legs. Poof! Red legs.

**6. “What if …?” **Ask yourself how the outcome may change if you change the input. Be merciless with the input, sensible with the output. “What if I posted once every 10 minutes to my blog for an entire week? My brain might turn to alfalfa, but I sure would get attention from the other bloggers in my niche. Maybe there’s a viral idea in there … how can I prevent the alfalfa and still get the attention? Aha! What if I just did this for one day? And all around a central theme? And invited others to do it too?”

**7. Be silly. **You’d be surprised at how many serious, useful ideas are born of ridiculous, useless parents. I say useless because so-called “crazy ideas” may not serve any real purpose by themselves - but they may become powerful means to coming up with totally sane concepts. So maybe Bob the barracuda’s image flashes in your mind, and you give him a bowtie and have him speak Hungarian backwards … and then you realize that the pattern on the bowtie would make a perfect logo for your blog, and that a single backwards word would make a brilliant catchphrase to go in your next post headline.

**8. Go sideways. **You think and act in well-worn paths all the time. When you practice honing your imagination, make sure to spend some time not forsaking those paths altogether, but rather following them for a while and then taking a brief detour. So if your habit is to answer every thoughtful comment left at your blog with a heartfelt expression of thanks, perhaps you might tweak (but not completely redo) your approach so that you always try to end with a follow-up question inviting further discussion.

**9. Consider opposites. **Let’s say your blog’s color scheme is dark on light. Without stopping to question your logic, just imagine the absolute photo negative opposite - a light on dark scheme. Allow both extremes to stand before you. Ponder their differences. What do you observe that can be applied whether or not you make a complete shift from the light scheme to its polar opposite?

**10. Tell a story.** Make it up as you go. It can be set in the past, present or future. “It’s tomorrow morning. I’m reading a bunch of new blog posts on how to increase my RSS subscriber numbers when there’s a knock at the door. It’s my favorite blogger! We’ve never met before, and it’s great to say hi in person. We sit down together and form a plan to play a practical joke on 100 other bloggers - the most audacious such plan ever concoted.” Etc. The point of this exercise is to evoke feelings or thoughts in passing that you can then latch on to and do something about.

**11. Drink from imaginative fountains. **Go to a creative blogger and ask them for inspiration. Talk to just about any eight-year-old. Watch a movie with lots of surprises in it. Just chug lots of IJ (imagination juice) and see what color your pee turns. :-) In other words, you are what you drink. So partake of as much creative content and conversation as possible.

**12. Mix things together. **Bob the barracuda and your first blog post. The aftertaste of strawberries and the smell of whipped cream. Put any two or more things together and see what happens.

**13. Consider iterations. **Ask yourself what the next logical step in a progression should be. Fetus, baby, child, adolescent, adult, worm food. So after you put out that huge resource list post to charm the legions of StumbleUpon, del.icio.us and Digg fans, then what? Then you’ll probably get a lot of first-time visitors to your blog. So how can you prepare for that influx? What needs to change about your design, your content and your community? After the social media traffic spikes come and go, then what? Etc.

**14. Apply everything. **Try to always glean a meaningful lesson from your escapades to the land of enchantment and imagination (or whatever you wish to call it). And apply each lesson or insight like mad to your blog and to your blogging activities.

**15. You tell me. **Please don’t let this list stop at 14. There are so many more ways to improve your imagination. Let me hear some from you. Imagination, when shared, becomes almost frighteningly powerful.

**1. Imagination isn’t everything. **It’s wonderful, but it’s still all in your head. You have to do real work to make the internal become external. But hard work can make imagination pay off like - well, I guess you can imagine. (We’ll cover hard work in our next article.)

**2. Imagination can be scary.** Especially when you let it run wild. Don’t let fear of the unknown paralyze you. You can control it. You can be its master. Remember what Mark Twain said: “Some of the worst things in my life never happened.”
