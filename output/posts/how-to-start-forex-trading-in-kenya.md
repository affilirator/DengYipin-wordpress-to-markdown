<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

For those who are new to forex trading, we recommend starting with a demo account. This will allow you to practice trading without risking any real money. Once you have gained some experience and confidence, you can then start trading with real money.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

In order to be successful in forex trading, it is important to learn as much as possible about the markets and use effective strategies. There are many resources available online that can help you do this. It is also important to stay up-to-date with the latest news and events that could affect the markets.

## What's Online Forex Trading in Kenya?

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Forex trading is the process of speculating on the movements of currency pairs, and is one of the most popular forms of trading in Kenya. Forex trading can be done through online brokers, and many Kenyans have turned to this form of trading as a way to make extra income. Forex trading is also a great way to diversify your investment portfolio.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When you trade forex, you are essentially betting on the movement of one currency against another. For example, if you think that the Kenyan Shilling will appreciate against the US Dollar, you would buy USD/KES. If your prediction turns out to be correct, you will make a profit. However, if the Kenyan Shilling depreciates against the US Dollar, you will make a loss.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The first step is the most important and it will take you the most effort.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Luckily for you, the cost of internet in Kenya has become ever so low, and accessibility to information is something you no longer have to worry about. This is unlike when we were personally trying to learn how to trade in 2012. Information was scarce. Internet was a special reserve for the wealthy. But those days are long gone.

##### Can you learn forex on YouTube?

Yes. YouTube is one of the best and free ways to learn forex trading. In fact, YouTube is solely responsible for creating some of the most successful forex traders in the world. There are a number of very informative YouTube channels including Adam Khoo, Meir Barak, and Rayner Teo.

<!-- /wp:rank-math/faq-block -->

<!-- /wp:uagb/section -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

YouTube has some very informative traders. The only downside is that unless you know exactly what you're looking for, it can get pretty confusing trying to learn from YouTube. One trader will tell you this while another one tells you a completely different thing.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

To make learning on YouTube more cohesive, we recommend that you choose two or three successful traders to follow. Some of our recommended

![Which is the best forex trading platform in Kenya](./images/wp-content-uploads-2021-03-Which-is-the-best-forex-trading-platform-in-Kenya.jpg)

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As you're learning how to trade forex, you'll come across a few trading platforms. The most popular ones out there are MT4, MT5, and cTrader.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It'd be foolhardy to try and muster how to use all the different trading platforms. As a beginner, just choose one of them and roll with it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

MT4 and MT5 are the most popular forex trading platforms with forex traders all over the world. But cTrader is making a name for itself as being one of the most versatile trading platform.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The only downside with cTrader is that not many forex brokers support the platform. The only logical choices left for you is either the MT4 or MT5 platforms.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":6} -->

###### So, what are the differences between MT4 and MT5, and why would you choose one over the other?

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->

1.  MT4 is primarily designed for tradeable **forex instruments** (currencies and some commodities) whereas MT5 is a state of the art forex trading platform that supports **both forex instruments and non-centralized financial markets including stocks, bonds, and futures**.
2.  The MT4 platform only **supports hedging**. In contrast MT5 supports hedging and netting. Netting is a concept in forex trading that combines multiple open orders into one. For instance, if you were to buy 1 lot of EUR/USD and later open another position in the same market, the two positions become one.
3.  **MT5 is faster than MT4**. MT4 uses an obsolete 32-bit mono-threaded technology while MT5 uses a 64-bit multi-threaded technology that makes it faster.

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Bottomline: MT5 is the best forex trading platform for beginner forex traders.
