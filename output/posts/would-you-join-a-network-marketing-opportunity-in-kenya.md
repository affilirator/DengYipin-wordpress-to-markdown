At some point in your life, you might have been persuaded to join a Network Marketing Opportunity in Kenya. While the promises of what you can achieve when you join a multi-level (MLM) or network marketing opportunity varies from company to company, one thing remains constant. Most of them promise infinite wealth that will make you ditch your 8-5 job, start your home-based business, and make new friends in the process.

The promises made by network marketing companies sound so good and irresistible when they are on paper. Yet, there is an unending debate on whether these network marketing opportunities really work, whether they are genuine and legal. The debate led me to dig for information on multi-level marketing in Kenya. As a result of the intense research I carried out, I am convinced that, _**when done right**_, network marketing opportunities could be the solution to the high rates of unemployment in Kenya.

However, not to put the cart before the horse, let us start by defining what is and what is not a** network marketing opportunity**.

### What is Network Marketing?

In its simplest form, network marketing is a marketing model that engages independent agents to reach prospective customers.

The genuine network marketing companies usually have products that you are supposed to buy and then sell to a relative, friend or any other business contact. Beware of network marketing companies that do not have any products they sell. _A network marketing company that draws most of its income from recruiting new members as opposed to buying products could be an illegal pyramid scheme_.

Most network marketing companies are also multi-level marketing opportunities (MLMs) that rewards you for bringing recruits into the business. The recruits form your 'downlines', and usually, there is a compensation plan that you get from their sales.

## Network Marketing Opportunities in Kenya

Network Marketing is not new in Kenya. I recall hearing of companies such as GNLD, Tiens Kenya, Tupperware and Mary Kay Cosmetics from my days as a young man. There are also a few other new entrants into the game including [SocialBizConnect](https://mahinge.com/socialbizconnect-sbc-kenya-review/ "sbc kenya")/[Internet Marketing Africa](https://mahinge.com/5-reasons-trust-internet-marketing-africa/), Forever Living, Herbalife and DIPEK among others.

All these companies promise to make you wealthy in a fortnight, but do they live to their promises? In this article, I am going to highlight the factors that you should consider when joining a Network Marketing Opportunity in Kenya.

Here are the 5 most important factors to consider before joining a network marketing opportunity in Kenya:
