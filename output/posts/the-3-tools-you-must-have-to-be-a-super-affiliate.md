Here's some important information which could cause to reconsider what you thought you understood about affiliate marketing or reinforce what you already know about affiliate marketing. Either way, it's a win-win.

So what exactly does it take to become a successful Affiliate Marketer and what are the ingredients of an affiliate marketing success story? Are there any shortcuts to Affiliate Marketing glory? These are all questions that run around in the minds of affiliate marketers striving for the big time. Affiliate Marketing is said to be one of the easiest and most effective ways to earn money online, but in truth, it is not as easy as it sounds. Wise affiliate marketers plan every action, execute them with precision, and utilize the correct tools necessary for a successful Affiliate Marketing business. I've researched some of the most successful affiliate marketers in the business and below are the top three tools necessary to begin a successful affiliate marketing campaign.

Tool #1: You need your own Website.

Having your own website is the most important and indispensable tool any successful Affiliate Marketer can have. It's the very first step in building any successful affiliate marketing business. Your website is the main portal to all your marketing efforts. Thus, you must build a appealing and user-friendly website, which encourages them to take some sort of action, i.e., filling out a form, making a purchase. Since most web users surf the web for information and not necessarily to buy something, it's important for your website be full of original, relevant and useful content. Content is still king and good quality content will build your credibility and will also help you achieve a higher search engine ranking. By regularly posting relevant, useful and informative articles, you will establish yourself as a credible expert in your niche. This will build trust, establish your reputation and begin building a loyal customer base.

Important Tool #2: Use incentives

The information about Affiliate Marketing presented here will do one of two things: either it will reinforce what you know about Affiliate Marketing or it will teach you something new. Both are good outcomes.

With competition extremely tight online, you must always pay attention to what your rivals are doing to ensure you get a share of your target market. You must use every means available to you to encourage your visitors to take action, i.e. filling out a form, making a purchase. Building an opt in list is one of the best ways to obtain prospects, referrals and make sales. One great way to build a opt in list is to offer an incentive to your visitors to encourage them to subscribe to your newsletter or ezine. You can give away free software, access to exclusive services or any other freebies that can be helpful to your prospects.

Important Tool #3: Link Popularity

Link Popularity is one factor that search engines use to determine search engine rankings Driving highly targeted traffic to your website cannot be emphasized enough. Web traffic is the lifeblood of any online enterprise. Attracting people to your site is the first step you should carry out. Do everything to achieve a high search engine ranking. Link Popularity is one factor that search engines use to determine search engine rankings and to enhance your link popularity and your search engine ranking, you must launch an link building campaign.

One of the best ways to do this – at no cost at all – is by submitting articles, with your name, brief overview of who you are and your site's link in the resource box, to e-zines and article directories. By doing so, not only will you gain exposure, you will be able to advertise for free, just by including a link back to your site. It goes without saying, the more sites you submit your articles to, the higher your link popularity will become. Just make sre your articles are original, relevant, useful and informative so that more websites will pick it up and post it.

These are three of many tools a successful affiliate marketer uses to maximize his/her earning potential. You are limited only by your imagination, creativity, resourcefulness, determination, but you must always be open to exploring other ideas and adopt other strategies. This will enable you to become a high rolling affiliate marketer.
