For many years, Provigil’s ‘official’ use was in the treatment of sleep anomalies such as narcolepsy. But that was before smart drugs became popular. In the past few years the drug has gained traction as a ‘smart drug’, and for a good reason too.

Provigil is awesomely different from other nootropics. Apart from helping your thinking become clearer, the drug, unlike some other popular nootropics, is not addictive. Neither does it leave you feeling ‘wired.’

## But what’s the true cost of Provigil?

If you buy Provigil- the brand name- you will end up paying a hefty amount of money for it.

For 15 100mg tablets of Provigil, the cost is $759 while 10 tablets of 200mg Provigil will cost you $230 or thereabout.

However, what most people don’t know is that there is a generic form of Provigil known as Modafinil, which is way cheaper than Provigil. There are also other brands of Provigil, including Modalert, which you can buy in a number of online stores.

### Provigil Generic Cost

You need to keep in mind that cost differences between generic Provigil and brand name medications containing the same ingredients in equal amounts can be quite hefty. If cost is your concern, we'd recommend that you go with the generic forms of Provigil.

Generic Provigil costs much cheaper than Provigil-the brand name. With about \$400, you can secure yourself yourself a months supply of 100mg Modafil tablets.
