The easiest and most effective (but riskiest) way to build backlinks to your niche site is to build a private blog network (PBN).

But assuming you don't have the risk appetite nor the finances involved in setting up a PBN, your only other most effective way of getting backlinks to your niche site is through blogger outreach.

This is where you email bloggers who are in a vertical or horizontal niche as you, and request them to link to your site either by publishing an infographic, guest post, adding you to their resources page, or replacing a broken link on their site with a resource from your blog.

The only perceived downside with the outreach strategy is that as humans, we tend to shy away from approaching total strangers and asking them for favors. There's the risk that we'll get an outright rejection, which most of us don't handle so well

But this shouldn't keep you from using blogger outreach as a way to get backlinks to your site. There's actually a tip that can considerably increase your success rate with blogger outreach; competitor analysis.
