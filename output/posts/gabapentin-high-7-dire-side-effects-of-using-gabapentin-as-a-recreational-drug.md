Does gabapentin get you high? If it does, you are not alone.

## Gabapentin Overview

Gabapentin is one of the most recent antiepileptic drugs. It has been used to treat neuropathic pain, epilepsy, migraines, and bipolar disorders. Although the drug is similar in structure to GABA, it neither affects GABA update nor GABA(a and b) receptors.

It efficacy as an anticonvulsant is still unclear, but there are indications that it possibly inhibits some voltage-activated calcium channels.

In 1997, a woman who had a cocaine problem found out that snorting her husband’s gabapentin quenched her craving for cocaine. That was the first ever reported case of someone using gabapentin to get a high.

In 2004, an investigation in Florida prison discovered that inmates were notoriously abusing gabapentin. Reportedly, it gave them a high that was as strong as a cocaine-induced high.

Since then, gabapentin has gained sort of a mainstream popularity as a recreational drug. The sudden popularity may at first seem inexplicable; after all, gabapentin is not categorized with other conventional substances of abuse.

But there have been reports of users taking the drug in superfluous daily dosages in order to induce a high. Those who fail to achieve a high feel cheated. They experiment with even higher dosages... but one thing I haven’t seen anyone worried about is whether there are any short term or long term effects of using gabapentin as a recreational drug.

But digging a little deeper will reveal why the abuse of drugs that are not normally categorized as substances of abuse is growing in popularity.

With prescription drugs such as Xanax and Oxycontin becoming increasingly restricted, users are turning to more accessible drugs. [Phenibut](http://nootropunch.com/phenibut-withdrawal/) is one of the other drugs that seems unlikely to be used for recreational purposes, but there have been numerous reports of users abusing it.

## What are the Long Term and Short Term Effects of Using Gabapentin to get a High?

Numerous [articles](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24760436,22822593,24835028,12454558,25930135,25667805,17388722,17327964,15370954,9315994,19361820?report=docsum) have been published in medical journals about the recreational potential of gabapentin in the last decade. The consensus is that gabapentin has low abuse potential.

But gabapentin can elicit euphoria, altered mental states, and disassociation in some users. Recreational gabapentin users have also reported that this anticonvulsant helps alleviate benzodiazepine and/or opiate withdrawal.
