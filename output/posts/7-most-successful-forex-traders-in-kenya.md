### Is Forex trading profitable in Kenya?

Yes, forex trading can be quite profitable in Kenya if you have the right skills and knowledge. There are many traders who make a full-time income from trading forex, and some who even become quite wealthy.

However, it takes more than just Skills and Economics 101 to beat the markets. You need to have strong self-discipline and emotional control, as well as a sound risk management strategy. And of course, it goes without saying that you need to have a decent amount of capital to start with.

But if you have what it takes, forex trading can be very profitable indeed. Just remember that like any form of investing, there is always risk involved – so don't risk more than you can afford to lose.

Some of the most successful forex traders in Kenya include Patrick Mahinge, Ken Githaiga, and Paul Mugenda. All of these traders have made a lot of money from trading forex, and they all have different strategies that they use to achieve success.
