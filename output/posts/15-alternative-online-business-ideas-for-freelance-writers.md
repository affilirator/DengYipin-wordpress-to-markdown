> For how long do you think you will remain a freelance writer?

Earning money as a freelance writer in Kenya is awesome. I mean, where else would you get paid for working under the comfort of your sheets?

However, working your entire life as a freelance writer is not cool. You will need to think of alternative ways to invest the cash you earn from writing so that when it comes to that time when you cannot write anymore, you will still have a consistent source of income.

You can either decide to start an offline business like I did awhile back when I started my Playstation Arcade business in Voi or you can choose to [start an online business](https://mahinge.com/online-business-ideas-kenya/ "Online Business Ideas in Kenya"). Starting an online business is by far the simplest way to go about it:

1.  The capital required is optimally low
2.  You do not have to worry about getting a strategic location for your business.

When you are building your business online, it doesn't matter whether you are in Yaya or Sarit, all you need is a website and a [web hosting account](https://mahinge.com/visit/ipage "Web hosting account"). The next step will be to figure out how to market your business through [social media marketing](https://mahinge.com/category/social-media-marketing/ "social media marketing"), [search engine optimization](https://mahinge.com/request-a-free-seo-analysis/ "search engine optimization Kenya") and [email marketing](http://blogscheme.aweber.com "Email Marketing").

If you really want to start an online business in 2015, I have got **10 of the best online business ideas for you that will finally let your money work for you.**

## **1. Start a niche website**

This is one of the time-tested [ways of making passive income online](https://mahinge.com/how-i-made-a-side-income-of-57k-working-from-home/ "Passive Online INcome"). A niche website is a website that is focused on one sole market/audience. The information on the blog is usually core to one topic that interests that audience.

A good example of a niche website is my [weight bench reviews website](http://weightbenchsetsz.com "weight bench reviews") that I started sometime back last year.

The budget to start a niche website will usually be in the tune of 5-10K. This money will cater for your domain name, your [web hosting account](https://mahinge.com/visit/ipage "web hosting account") and web designing.

To keep your initial costs low, I recommend that you start with a web hosting account at iPage. Although they are cheap, I find their services quite excellent compared to the expensive alternatives in the market.

### How to build a niche website

In order to build a niche website, you will have to research the niche that you want to get into. This includes

- analyzing how large and interested your prospective market is
- Are there products to be marketed in that particular niche?
- How well are your competitors established and how many are they?
- Do you have the passion and interest to keep blogging on that particular niche

### How do you make money from a niche website?

There are several ways that you can make money from a niche website. The best is usually through affiliate marketing.

- If you manage to make your blog really authoritative you can also get paid for sponsored reviews of products in your niche

## 2. Start an eCommerce store

Does eCommerce even work in Kenya?

Trust me it does. The secret lies in finding a market that is so much in need that they will have to buy what you have to sell. An example of an eCommerce store that is doing very well in Kenya is [Jumia](http://jumia.co.ke "Jumia"). There are several other offshoot eCommerce stores such as Soko Langu, Kaymu, MImi, Mama Mikes among others.

Although the offshoot stores may appear quite small and ineffective at this time, give them another 5 years and you will be surprised at how much they will have grown.

The secret is to start now and grow your online business in several years. I believe that we are headed to years when online shopping in Kenya is going to blossom beyond anyone's imagination.

Starting an **Ecommerce store in Kenya** can be a little expensive than starting a **niche website**. Apart from the [domain, web hosting and design fees](https://mahinge.com/visit/ipage "Web hosting"), you will also need capital for products that you will sell on your ecommerce store.

However, the next idea, which is almost similar to having your own ecommerce store, keeps the costs of starting an online business quite low.

## 3. Starting a Online Marketplace for Third Party Products

In Kenya, the best model of a marketplace that comes to mind is [Rupu, popular for online deals](https://www.rupu.co.ke/feature-my-business "Rupu"). With an online marketplace, [you create the website](https://mahinge.com/web-design-branding-services-kenya/ "Create a website in Kenya"), and let businesspersons in Kenya upload their products for sale through your website. You may either charge them a commission for every sale made or charge them a one-time fee for the use of your website to sell their products. Charging a commission works best.

Incredibly, building such a website won't even cost you 10,000/=. I recently [designed such a website](https://mahinge.com/web-design-branding-services-kenya/) for one of my clients using the [Marketify Theme from Themeforest](http://themeforest.net/item/marketify-marketplace-wordpress-theme/6570786?ref=Patrick-M "Themeforest") and the results were just ecstatic!

## 4. Training and Mentoring

This is by far the **best online business idea in Kenya**. Everyone has a skill or art that they can teach. Instead of languishing in employment, [create a website](https://mahinge.com/web-design-branding-services-kenya/ "Create a website in Kenya") and an e-course and start selling your skills online.

I am sure that you have come across those ladies and gentlemen offering you [online freelance writing training on Facebook](http://andikawriters.com "Andika Writers"). They are making a killing at it... and just by teaching what they already know.

The reason why training and mentoring is so awesome is because you only need to create your e-course once, and make money from it for a lifetime. You can literally retire from every other form of work and concentrate solely on training.

[Here is one of the coolest online training websites that I have seen in Kenya so far...](http://academy.kenyaforexfirm.co.ke/course/forex-trading-training-kenya/)

And yes, the business belongs to no other but yours truly.

### How to Start an Online Training Business?

To start an online training business, you will need a website. You will also need a theme that has LMS (Learning Management System) capabilities or an LMS Plugin.

To create [my forex training ecourse](http://academy.kenyaforexfirm.co.ke/course/forex-trading-training-kenya/), [I used the WPLMS theme from Themeforest](http://themeforest.net/item/wplms-learning-management-system/6780226?ref=Patrick-M "WPLMS"). It is quite a flexible theme that does everything that a learning management system can do. You can also use [Learndash](http://www.learndash.com/pricing-and-purchase/) and [WP Courseware](https://flyplugins.com/wp-courseware/) Wordpress plugins to create your online course, and they do work awesomely. However, if you are looking for my opinion, [WPLMS Wordpress theme](http://themeforest.net/item/wplms-learning-management-system/6780226?ref=Patrick-M) is the way to go.

You can hire me to create your online learning management system.

## 5. Kindle Direct Publishing

Sometime last year, [I explained how the Kindle business model works](https://mahinge.com/introducing-kindle-bestsellers-program/ "Kindle publishing").

Kindle, a subbranch of the popular Amazon store, gives an opportunity to anyone who can write to create simple ebooks and offer them for sale to an audience of more than 300 million book lovers. By following the tips provided in my [Kindle Bestsellers Program](https://mahinge.com/product/kindle-bestsellers-how-to-make-a-killing-writing-and-selling-simple-kindle-ebooks/ "Kindle Bestsellers Program"), you can make a stable income for yourself and your family simply by publishing ebooks on Kindle.
