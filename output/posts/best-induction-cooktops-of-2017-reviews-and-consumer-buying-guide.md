An induction cooktop is a cooking surface that can only work when metal is placed on top of it. This type of cooking device works by using a copper wire and a magnetic field which causes whatever is in your metal pot or pan to get hot.

The big advantage to this type of cooktop is that it will not become active unless you have placed metal on top of it. In addition to this, there is no gas and no open flame.

This means you’ll never have to worry about a gas leak or a gas explosion from your induction cooktop. When looking at _induction cooktop reviews_, this is something you really want to think about.

Another advantage of this cooktop is that it uses less energy than other cooking devices. In addition to this, it is much easier to clean. This is because the surface is flat and can easily be wiped down after use.

One big disadvantage that you might want to think about when looking at induction cooktop reviews is the fact that you are limited in what kinds of pans you can use.

An induction surface only works with magnetic metals and will not work well with pots and pans that cannot hold a magnet. Stone pots and pans are absolutely useless on an induction oven.

Another minor disadvantage is that you must use pots and pans with flat surfaces. I say this is a minor disadvantage, because I cannot think of any pots and pans that I have owned that did not have a flat surface on them.

## **Best Induction Cooktop Reviews**

Below I’ll provide some induction cooktop reviews on some of the best induction cookers for single pots.

### [![best cookware for induction cooktop](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Truetop-cooktop-300x251.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/True-Induction-S2F2-Cooktop-Efficient/dp/B004BFVWKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=crypwrit-20&linkId=84ad41a82f0bf940acee160844c6feb9)True Induction S2F2 Cooktop

True Induction is known for their high quality induction cooktops and this one is definitely one of the best induction cooktops for 2017.

The cooktop is made of an easy to clean ceramic glass surface. The easy to use, touch controls are located on the front of the induction cooktop.

In terms of cooking power, the cooktop has two heating elements and a maximum of 1800 watts of heating power. The cooktop can easily go from 150 degrees Fahrenheit to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.

It’s not that expensive either, going for only around $320; which is pretty good when you consider some induction cooktops can go as high as $1500, if not higher.

The True Induction cooktop is definitely a great cooktop and you should give this one a look if you are interested.

### [![best portable induction cooktop](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Frigidaire-Induction-Cooktop-300x251.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Frigidaire-FGIC3067MB-Induction-Cooktop-Black/dp/B005ECTRE4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=crypwrit-20&linkId=d79ebaa81c9238b51c2fe7e82fbeaf62)Frigidaire FGIC3067MB 30″ Induction Cooktop

Moving onto a larger, more expensive model.

The Frigidaire has to be put into a hole cut into the countertop and is not mobile like the True Induction; it’s also fairly expensive at around \$1100.

But if you’re willing to suffer through the costs and instillation, the [Frigidaire FGIC3067MB induction cooktop](https://www.amazon.com/Frigidaire-FGIC3067MB-Induction-Cooktop-Black/dp/B005ECTRE4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=crypwrit-20&linkId=d79ebaa81c9238b51c2fe7e82fbeaf62) is an extremely good investment.

Its energy efficient so if you cook a lot, you should notice a decrease in energy bills. But that doesn’t mean the Frigidaire is weak. In fact, the cooktop has 4 heating elements that can reach a maximum of 3,400 watts of cooking power.

The cooktop is able to boil water, cook food, etc. extremely fast; definitely a time saver. This is absolutely one of the top induction cooktops out there and if you can stomach the cost you will be getting a great product.

### BergHOFF Single Touch Screen Induction Cook Top

[![best rated induction cooktop](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Berghof-induction-cooktop-2017-300x251.jpg)](http://amzn.to/2cwWLwM)Berghoff is a manufacturer of kitchen products, primarily knives, but they also produce lines of skillets, frypans, and baking trays. But this induction is their first attempt at an actual cooking implement.

The **[Berghoff induction cooktop](https://www.amazon.com/BergHOFF-Single-Touch-Screen-Induction/dp/B0040SYUEK//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=crypwrit-20&linkId=96b648894f89b9ea77da5bc1a2dbe6b1)** comes in three distinct sizes: single, double, and XL. The single size only has a single cooktop, as does the XL size, while the double has two cooktops.

There is much to like about the Berghoff models and you won’t go wrong with buying any of the models.

#### **COST**

The main difference between the models is their cost. The Single size is the cheapest by far. But its price is actually fair costly as far as induction cooktops go, but the quality and materials are top notch so it’s understandable that it costs more than your average induction cooktop.

The XL size is a bit more expensive. Finally, the Double model is the most expensive, which is due to the presence of two burners on the cooktop.

#### Should you buy this?

Berghoff induction cooktops are very powerful, at 1600 watts for the single and XL model and 1800 watts on the double model. They have also temperature levels ranging from 150 degrees to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.

Both the Single and Double models are easily controlled via a touchpad controls on the front of the cooktop, while the XL uses a knob system that’s slightly more cumbersome to use.

They are perfect for dorm rooms, people going to cottages, or just if you want a portable cooktop.

Being that they are induction cooktops, they are energy efficient and you don’t have to worry about heating up the room (making them a great choice for the summer months). So you will save money on energy by using a Berghoff induction cooktop.

### DUXTOP 1800-Watt Portable Induction Cooktop

[![Best induction cooktop reviews 2017](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Duxtop-induction-cooktop-review-300x251.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/1800-Watt-Portable-Induction-Countertop-8300ST/dp/B00H8NJK6W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=crypwrit-20&linkId=5effa3dff3f83288cd6cc4e5796dbec4)This induction cooktop from DUXTOP is a well built and affordable single burner induction cooktop.

It has a multitude of cooking options including:

- 10 temperature range (140 degrees Fahrenheit to 460 degrees Fahrenheit)
- 10 power levels going from 200 watts to 1800 watts
- built in timer that goes in 1 minute increments up to a maximum of 170 watts.
- All these options are easily controlled via a digital control panel.

The Duxtop Induction Cooktop also has some helpful safety features, namely detection system where in the cooktop will shut down if no pan is detected after 60 seconds.

The cooktop also comes with a diagnostic error messaging system, so you will know if something is wrong with the cooktop.

All in all The DUXTOP is a very good single burner induction cooktop and it can be found for around \$60; which makes this cooktop a great addition to your kitchen.

### Ivation 1800 Watt Portable Induction Countertop Cooktop

[![best induction cooktop](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Ivation-1800-induction-cooktop-review-300x251.jpg)](http://amzn.to/2cwZEh9)The other single burner induction cooktop I am looking at in this article.

It’s a bit more expensive than the DUXTOP at around \$80, but it is largely the same feature wise.

Like the DUXTOP, the Ivation comes with 10 temperature settings, ranging from 140 degrees to 460 degrees Fahrenheit, it also comes with 10 power levels, also going from 200 watts to 1800 watts.

In terms of safety features the two cooktops are very similar, the Ivation features a child lock that prevents children from using the cooktop, but besides that is the exact same the DUXTOP in terms of safety features.

Overall it’s a great **single burner induction cooktop** and you won’t go wrong with purchasing this one.

Regardless of whether you get the Ivation or the DUXTOP, you will be getting a high quality induction cooktop, although the DUXTOP is a cheaper option and thus I would recommend getting the DUXTOP if possible.

### Electrolux EW361C60LB Induction Cooktops

[![best rated induction cooktop](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Electrolux-induction-cooktop-review-300x251.jpg)](http://amzn.to/2cJo5Hi)The [Electrolux EW36IC60LB Induction Cooktop](http://amzn.to/2cJo5Hi) is a non-portable induction cooktop from the company Electrolux; who manufactures a wide variety of appliances.

#### **Features**

- Product dimensions are 25 x 41 x 8 inches
- The product weighs about 75 pounds
- Responsive control system
- Specifically designed surface meant to stay cooler while cooking is going on
- 5 burners
- Multiple settings, including a “keep warm” option

The **Electrolux induction cooktop** is very responsive and efficient. The controls make it easy to set the exact heat you want, what burners you want working, and at what heat.

I’m not usually a fan of digital controls, but the **Electrolux induction cooktop** makes controlling your cooktop very easy. It’s also very efficient to cook with; water can be boiled in a couple minutes and food can be cooked in half the time it usually takes on a gas or electric model.

The glass surface is easy to clean, I just soap and water and it works like an absolute charm. I really hated cleaning up my older electric stove, because food would get in the cooktops and be baked in; it was just an all-around hassle. No with this induction cooktop.

The model needs to be installed. So, if you are not technically proficient you will need to pay an electrician to hook it up, which can be a bit of burden, especially cost wise.

The unit also has a weird tendency to buzz on higher heat levels. It’s not loud, but it is noticeable.

The glass can chip if you are not careful when cleaning it, but this can be avoided with some extra diligence when cleaning.

### GE PP9030SJSS Electric Induction Cooktop

[![best induction cooktop portable](https://mahinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GE-Induction-Cooktop-Reviews-300x251.jpg)](http://amzn.to/2cJsgD8)The GE induction cooktop is extremely powerful and efficient.

I was personally just shocked at how fast it could cook food or boil liquid. It only took 10 minutes to boil 6 quarts of water.

The right most burner can up to a heat level of 3200 Watts. Which is more than enough for any cooking job you will ever need to do.

It is very easy to clean. One thing that does not get mentioned much when talking about Induction cooktops is just how easy it is to keep it spotless and looking as good as new.

With gas or electric stoves you get grime, or food falls into the cooktop and gets burnt. With the best induction cooktops you just need to wipe the smooth glass surface and bravo, its clean.

#### Features

- Product dimensions are 21.4 x 29.8 x 4.6 inches
- It weighs about 41 pounds
- 4 Induction elements
- Electronic touch controls
- 19 different control settings

There are two major cons with this product.

Firstly, it is a costly investment. The initial unit will run over \$1000, and if you need at least a 40 amp breaker in order to get the most power out of the cooktop.

Also, depending on your skill you may need to hire an electrician to install the cooktop for you. If all this sounds like a lot, keep in mind that the GE induction cooktop uses very little electricity, so your energy bills should be less.

The cookware needs to be “ferrous” which means magnetic. So cast iron or stainless steel. It’s not hard to find cookware made of this material, but it’s still a negative aspect worth highlighting.
