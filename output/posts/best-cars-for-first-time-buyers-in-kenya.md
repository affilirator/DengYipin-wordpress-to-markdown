When buying your first car in Kenya, there are a lot of factors to consider. But don't worry, we're here to help!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

For example, what kind of engine does it have? Is it a gas guzzler or is it fuel efficient? What about the stereo system - is it top of the line or just basic? And most importantly, how much money can you afford to spend on your new ride?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So before you go out and buy that shiny new sports car, make sure you read our guide first! It might just save you a lot of money in the long run.

### 1. Budget

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Prices for cars in Kenya vary depending on the make and model of the car. Generally, new cars are more expensive than used cars. Some popular brands of cars in Kenya include Nissan, Toyota, and Subaru.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A budget is important when buying your first car because it will help you stay within your price range and not overspend on a vehicle.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When determining how much you can afford to spend on a car, it's important to take into account not only the purchase price of the car but also other associated costs such as insurance, registration, and taxes.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It's also important to be realistic about how much you can afford each month for car payments and set a budget that allows you to save enough money for unexpected repairs or maintenance costs.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

By setting a budget and sticking to it, you'll be able to buy the car that's right for you without going into debt. Once you have a budget in mind, you can start looking for cars that fit within that budget.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### 2. Test Drive

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It's important to test drive when buying your first car in Kenya because you want to make sure the car is comfortable and a good fit for you.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**When test-driving a new car, it's important to check for a smooth ride, no unusual noises, and good braking ability. You should also take the car for a spin on different types of roads to see how it handles.**

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When you're test driving a car, be sure to pay attention to the following:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- How well the car handles on different types of roads
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->
-
- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- The seat height and position. Make sure the seat is comfortable and provides good support.
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->
-
- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- The visibility. Make sure all of the mirrors are adjustable and that you can see clearly out of the windows.
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->
-
- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- The brakes. Test the brakes at different speeds to make sure they feel responsive and provide adequate stopping power.
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->
-
- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- The steering wheel. Make sure it's adjustable so you can find a comfortable driving position.
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->
-
- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- \-The engine noise. Listen for any strange noises or vibrations that could indicate a problem with the engine.
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->
-
- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- How easily the car accelerates and brakes
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->
-
- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- The size of the car and how spacious it is inside
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->
-
- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- The sound of the engine and whether it's too noisy or not
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->
-
- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- The visibility while driving, both through the windshield and rearview mirror
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->
-
- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- If there are any blind spots that need to be tested out
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Be sure to test drive any cars that interest you and take into account your needs and wants in a vehicle. Don’t just consider the car’s exterior; take it out on the road to make sure you like what you see. You may want to ask friends, family, or even co-workers for recommendations on models they like and trust.

### 3. Have a Mechanic With You When Buying a Used Car

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":707,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->

![How much should I earn to buy a car in Kenya?](./images/wp-content-uploads-2022-02-How-much-should-I-earn-to-buy-a-car-in-Kenya.jpg)

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When buying used cars, it is important that your mechanic check out any car before finalizing the sale. If the seller is reluctant to allow this, then walk away from the deal--it could save you a lot of money and stress in the future.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A mechanic can help you inspect a used car for any potential safety or mechanical issues. By identifying and addressing any problems up front, you can avoid costly repairs down the road.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Additionally, a good mechanic can give you an idea of how much work may need to be done on the car and how much it will cost. This information is invaluable when negotiating a price with a seller.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If you're not comfortable inspecting a car yourself, it's always best to have a professional take a look. A small investment in having a mechanic check out the car will save you time, money, and headaches down the road.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Even if you are not buying a used car, it is still wise to have your mechanic check out the car. Sometimes the price of a car is negotiable, but you need to make sure it is in good condition before finalizing any plans for purchase.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### 4. Keep it simple at the dealership

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When you're at a car dealership, don't let yourself get overwhelmed. There are thousands of different models and make/models, but keep it simple by just looking at a few different cars.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Rather than considering every car that interests you, focus your attention on a few that seem to have the features and focal points that are important to you. If one of these models falls within your price range, take it out for a test drive.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If not, go back inside and look at another handful of cars from the same dealership to see if any fit the bill. This way you can quickly narrow down your search for a car without getting overwhelmed or spending hours going through options.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### 5. Don't sign anything until you're sure it's right

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When you go to purchase your first car, it is important to read all of the paperwork before you sign anything. This will help protect you from any surprises down the road. Some of the things you should look for include:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The terms of the sale

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- The price of the car
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->
-
- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- The amount of the down payment
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->
-
- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- Monthly payments
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->
-
- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- The interest rate
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->
-
- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- The length of the loan
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->
-
- <!-- wp:list-item -->
- Any other fees that will/may be applied
- <!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

One way car dealerships in Kenya try to take advantage of first time buyers is by getting them to sign off on paperwork without reading it carefully. If you're not careful, you may end up committing to things like extended warranties or service contracts that you don't actually want or need.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It's always a good idea to read through all the paperwork before signing anything, and if there are any questions, don't hesitate to ask the dealership representative. They should be more than happy to answer any questions you have and explain everything in detail. Remember, you aren't obligated to sign anything until you're 100% satisfied with everything you've read.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### 6. Don't buy any add-ons at the dealership

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Be sure to avoid the temptation of buying add-ons at the car dealership. It can be easy to get swept up in the moment and agree to expensive extras like extended warranties, paint protection, and fabric protection. But before you know it, you've added hundreds or even thousands of dollars to the price of your car.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The best way to avoid this is to come into the dealership with a firm idea of what you want and what you're willing to pay for. That way, you won't be swayed by aggressive sales tactics or pressure from the dealer. And if there are any extras that you really want, like a sunroof or upgraded sound system, try to wait until you get home and do some research on the best prices for the addons you want. You'll likely be able to find better deals online than at the dealership.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

By avoiding the high markups at the dealer, you can save yourself a lot of money in the long run. Think carefully before agreeing to have any additional features installed on your new car--they are not free and it is possible for you to get them yourself at a later date if needed.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### 7. Don't feel pressured by anyone

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Sometimes when you walk onto a car lot there are people who are overly eager to make a sale, even if that means pushing their product onto someone who doesn't actually want it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

You shouldn't feel pressured into buying a car if you aren't 100% behind it. These salespeople are counting on the fact that most people will simply agree to what they're saying in order to get out of there or avoid an argument.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Stick with your gut and make sure you are comfortable with whatever decision you make when it comes to buying a new auto. There will always be another one down the road if this one doesn't work out, so don't feel obligated to buy anything you don't want or need.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### 8. Buy Based on Purchase Price, Not on Monthly Payments

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It can be tempting to get caught up in the monthly payments for your car loan. Perhaps you've heard that it's possible to calculate what your car payment will be before you ever go to the dealer.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

To do this, simply take the purchase price of the car and divide it by 24 (or however many months are available on the financing option you're considering). This will give you an idea of what your monthly payment will cost.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But don't fall into this trap! It's easy to get caught up in paying hundreds of dollars per month but if you aren't careful, it could end up costing you thousands more than necessary over the life of your auto loan.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Instead, look at how much money is needed for a down payment and the overall purchase price of the car. This will give you a better idea of what your monthly payments will be because it factors in the interest rates as well.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So instead of getting mortaged up over small monthly payments, focus on finding a fair deal by getting pre-approved for financing before going to the dealer. That way, you won't fall into any high-pressure sales tactics and can confidently present an offer that is based on only one thing: buying a car you can afford.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### 9. If a deal sounds too good to be true...

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Another thing to watch out for is scams. Unfortunately, there are quite a few scam artists out there who will try to take advantage of unsuspecting buyers. So if something feels too good to be true, it probably is. Some sellers might offer "too good to be true" prices because they want to disappear with your money immediately after you hand it over.
