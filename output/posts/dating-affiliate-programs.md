Dating, dating, dating. You all want to know how to do it. You all want to know how to do it and make 4 figures profit a day.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Well, its not the cake walk it was a few years ago. You can’t just slap up some random babes images with huge knockers and gravity-defying cleavage on Facebook and expect to make \$1k a day. You entered the game far too late. So how does one ball without fallin’?

## Pick Your Network

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

EWA, WSM, NDemand Affiliates and Adsimilis are all good places to pick a dating offer. They all payout on time, they got hundreds of dating offers to pick from, from your generic dating offers, like True or Mate1, to your niche dating (mature, Asian, black, etc). Sign up to all of them and split test to see which network gives you the highest EPC (just because 1 network might pay out more on an offer doesn’t mean you’ll be rolling in more cash).

## Pick Your Offer

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Here’s what I’ll do when I’m in need of an offer and don’t know what to run: run them all. I’ve got a custom script built into Prosper 202 that works kind of like the built-in rotator, but basically adds another tab to the navigation bar and a new page that lets me pick offers from each network and add as many of them to this “offer rotator” as I want. I can then select this and shoot out 1 link that will track all the sub-id and conversion info for all that. I can add and remove offers from that rotator as I start getting data on it.It cost about \$100 to get it coded into P202, so it wasn’t a huge investment and has pushed me forward through a lot of what I can do in P202. If you are looking for a poor mans version of this, [here you go](https://web.archive.org/web/20140715014322/http://prosper.tracking202.com/scripts/rotate-offers/).

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Any who, you take all the offers in your niche, throw up a generic dating ad, and literally just let it collect data. Expensive? Yes, but it normally pays for itself once you know what offers are going to covert with the highest EPC.

## Track Your Sh#t

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Prosper 202, OpenX, Bevo, or [CPVLab](https://web.archive.org/web/20140715014322/http://justindupre.com/recommends/cpvlab) are the main trackers to check out. Put them on [a good dedicated VPS or server](https://web.archive.org/web/20140715014322/http://justindupre.com/recommends/wiredtree). If you aren’t [tracking](https://web.archive.org/web/20140715014322/http://justindupre.com/recommends/cpvlab), you’re losing money.

## Where To Market

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Here’s a run down of where you can ball with your dating offers:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Plenty of Fish – Easy as hell to make money. Cheap clicks, high CTR, but here’s the catch – NO VOLUME. This low volume means you’ll be burning through ads on a daily basis. You’re going to have to constantly watch your daily CTRs (which unfortunately they don’t make easy). That being said, it’s great for testing offers. I’ll usually run everything here first, gather data, see what demographics are getting me the highest EPC (Easily done when you can use variables like age and location in the sub-id), and pause stuff once I think I’ve collected enough. Sometimes I’ll pass on campaign management to my assistant, but the money you can make on dating here is scarce unless you’ve got 20 people managing 100 campaigns for you.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Facebook – Lots of international money to make here. If you want to do domestic dating on FB, you can give it a shot, but I can’t say I would recommend it. It’s hard to get anything past the ad (dis)approval team without risking having your account banned. With international dating, you can sneak in some more adult language in the ads, pay less per click, and generate more money per dollar spent. Use a [landing page](https://web.archive.org/web/20140715014322/http://justindupre.com/recommends/landingpages)!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

PPV (TrafficVance, MediaTraffic, etc) – Don’t be a dum-dum. Targeting dating sites with dating offers = bidding wars and no money unless you are auto-optimizing. The key here is knowing your demographics, where to find them, and what sort of mood are they in. Use a [landing page](https://web.archive.org/web/20140715014322/http://justindupre.com/recommends/landingpages) and play to the users current emotions on whatever you’re popping over them. Sites about dealing with depression here are great. People on these types of sites are probably feeling pretty lonely. Give them a solution…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Direct Banner Buys – Simple. Easy. Cheap. Know how to talk. Split test your emails when trying to contact webmasters. Want to split test your ad banners you’ll be placing on sites? See Plenty of Fish above. Want to test out the sites traffic first? See PPV above. Not a lot of affiliates go out of their way to work off of self-service platforms. Maybe its a communication issue, they’re scared of stepping outside of what everyone talks about, or they’re just lazy, but there is a lot of money to be made here. Go out and try it!

## How Much Money Do I Need?

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So how much money are you going to need to have saved to realistically, see some money from dating affiliate offers? What you have to think about here is that this is a business that I am running, and that thousands of other affiliates are running. The more you put in to your business, the higher the risk yet the higher the reward. If you want, you could go at this with $100. You’ll probably walk away from your computer pissed off that you just spend $100 only to make back $20, though. The bare minimum I’d enter into affiliate marketing with, in any niche, is $1000, and I’d stick to small tests on PPV and PoF with that. A better amount to start with would be around \$5k.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Don’t have $5k? Get a second job. Freelance. Become a VA. Write. Design. Network. Tutor. Get investors. Ask friends and family for money (“Hey Dad! I need $5000 to drop some booby ads on Facebook. Thanks!”). Sell your stuff. There aren’t any real excuses to “I don’t have enough money or the means to make some extra cash, because even writing for 1 cent per word is extra cash that could realistically make you \$10 – 20 per hour (I did this when I was 19 and in college and it was very decent money).
