First things first. Here is a standing ovation to all the great minds that write great scripts that ultimately become social media networks! And here is a scolding look at all the idiots who don't know how to effectively use social media networks.

Moving on...

I was in LinkedIn earlier today looking for motivation or something closer to what people seek in social media channels. I came across [this Group](http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem "LinkedIn") that I had joined ages ago yet had not been contributing to (I hate when that happens, and love it when my name appears on the sidebar as one of the top contributors to a LinkedIn Group, like I have it here). Anyway, there was that group. It is majorly dedicated to connecting freelance writers with clients. A client or fellow freelance writer will post job openings and probably the contact details of the 'client'.

What surprised me and sparred me to write a [lengthy piece on the group's wall](http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem "LinkedIn") is the amount of freelance writers who are willing to paste their email addresses on the groups page! They are giving email scrapers a day out not forgetting Paypal hackers, scammers and fraudsters.

Read on to see my [alternative recommendations to giving out your email address](http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem).
