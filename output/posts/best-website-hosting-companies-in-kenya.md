A web host is more like a rented storage space for your files and apps. There are several web hosting options available for interested users in Kenya. Some of the daring and controversial options for hosting include

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->

1.  <!-- wp:list-item -->
2.  **i. \*\***To Buy Your Own Server\*\*
3.  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Buying your own server allows you freedom. The freedom includes your total control over what you do with it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

However, buying your own server does not solve all your problems like a magic wand does. Owning a server is a tall order in its own right. As a server owner, you need to maintain it constantly.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

You also need a technical team that will create the necessary infrastructure to keep you present on the web.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The controversial bit of this option is the fact that it is an expensive venture. Most companies can simply not afford to put up and maintain a web server. The technical challenges are obviously digressive to the core business of the company. It is best to leave the development and maintenance of servers to people who are dedicated to this course.
