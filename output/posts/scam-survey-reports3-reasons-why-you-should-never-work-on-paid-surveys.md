It is one of those Friday afternoons when everything in the office does not seem to be moving. The Quartz Analog Clock on the wall stopped moving its hour hand soon after two. The internet drags its loading time. It is simply kind of hellish here. I peer into my colleagues office cubicle to find out what he is doing. Call it being snoopy. He is clicking ads in Neobux for money!

Really.

I want to tell him that Neobux does not pay. That it is a great waste of time to try make money from clicking on paid ads and doing online surveys. I however restrain myself because,

1.  no one in the office likes being snooped on, and
2.  I remember that I also started my journey to making money online on Neobux and Clixsense, and no one ever told me I was wasting my time. I just snapped out of it after working for so long without making as much money as I expected to make.
