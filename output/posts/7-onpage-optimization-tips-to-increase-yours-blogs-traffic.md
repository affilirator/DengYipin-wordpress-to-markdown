## Keyword research

You probably already know the **importance of keywords for ranking**. Though you may already have a list of them it’s never too late to make sure that your list is updated with newer keywords.

The key to successful keyword research is to have a list of keywords and phrases that range somewhere between 100 and 300. This should be directly related to your products or services.

Most of these should be long tail keywords and should be more specific and oriented towards specific categories. The other should be generic and short tail keywords.

However, it is important to note that using thousands of keywords will not guarantee that you rank well. If it did, I bet Google would have a problem deciding who stays on the first page.

However using **keywords that are not too competitive** is a good way to start. Simply because a keyword isn’t competitive does not mean that it is not worthwhile. To come up with a keyword strategy, there are a number of keyword research tools available. Some of these are free, and my all time favorite is the Google Keyword Research Tool.

## Formulating a landing page strategy

The next step after choosing your keywords is to make a spreadsheet with your keywords on one column and in the next column the page that a person searching for that keyword in your site should land. This is what is referred to as a landing page strategy.

The choice of the landing page is best based on your target audience. Most often than not you will be tempted to make your home page the landing page. Though this is no such a bad idea, it would not hurt if people land in the interior content. The interior content is most likely more appropriate to them and definitely a better selling tool

In addition optimizing the interior content with the **long tail keywords** is much easier than optimizing the home page. This will also derive the added advantage of having the potential to raise your overall visibility.

## Title page optimization

The third column in your spread sheet is the title page of the page listed in the spreadsheet. Optimizing title pages is simple.

The page should describe the content of the page with strategic use certain keywords you are targeting.

Use a few characters in your title page. The ideal number is 70. If the number goes beyond that the search engines will truncate it. Differentiate between a keyword rich title page and a keyword stuffed title page. The ideas id to be keyword rich. A keyword rich title page with under 70 characters will most likely invite the user to click. On the other hand a keyword stuffed long title page may not even make sense to the user.

## URLs Optimization

Optimizing your ULRs like title page optimization has its benefits. You can actually use you keyword rich titles to form a URL. Such a URL will have a strategic keyword in it. Unless you are designing a new website I advise that you don’t go changing all your URLs. Changing URLs for an already running page can be very disastrous for your ranking. Those pages are most likely already indexed by the search engines.

If you must change the URLs you must create a 301 redirect. This is a long and tedious job that is very time consuming.

However before you decide to change your URLs you should consider ho your site is ranking. If it ranks poorly then it could be worth it but is it ranks well reestablishing your ranking to the level you already were or higher could take quite some time. In my opinion it’s just not worth it.

## Metadata optimization

This has to do with the description tags. Use different description pages for different sites. A good description page should not be more than 156 characters.

## Content optimization

The thing that most people are interested in in your site is the content. The content should be keywords rich and not keyword stuffed.
