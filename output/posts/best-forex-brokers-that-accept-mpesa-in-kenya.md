There's no doubt about it, Mpesa has revolutionized the way we do business, and it continues to get more innovative with every passing day. In this guide, we are going to focus on the best forex brokers with Mpesa. We have included a list of 10 of the best forex brokers with Mpesa.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Among the industries that have seen a bigger impact from Mpesa's global penetration is forex trading in Kenya using Mpesa.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

You see, there used to be a time when depositing money into your forex trading account used to be a real hassle. Banks were declining transactions, and sending money into online wallets such as Skrill and Neteller used to be a real hassle.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Enter Mpesa, however, and its global acceptability. That really changed things for many forex traders in Kenya. Although a lot of forex brokers still do not offer Mpesa deposits and withdrawals, there's a good number who have the payment system.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

HotForex has consistently ranked top on our list of [forex brokers that accept Mpesa](https://kenyaforexfirm.co.ke/xm-forex-get-30-bonus-when-you-open-a-live-account/) in Kenya, and for good reasons too. The HotForex Mpesa deposit process is as easy as it can get. This is because HotForex is one of the few [CMA licensed forex brokers in Kenya](https://kenyaforexfirm.co.ke/forex-brokers-regulated-by-cma/).

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But before I show you why this forex broker happens to be our #1 rated Mpesa forex broker, let's first discuss about who they really are and why you should choose them as your goto forex broker in Kenya.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

To start with, HotForex allows you to

#### Why Choose HotForex in Kenya

<!-- /wp:uagb/advanced-heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Apart from the obvious fact that HotForex accepts Mpesa, here are 5 other reasons why most Kenyans prefer to trade with HotForex

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5,"align":"left","className":"uagb-heading-text"} -->

##### 1. Easy Copy Trading for Beginners

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

HotForex has one of the most developed [copy trading platforms](https://kenyaforexfirm.co.ke/forex-social-trading/) in the world. This platform, which is christened HfCopy allows beginners who do not have any knowledge/skills to profitably invest in the forex market by automatically copying trades of the most successful and skilled forex traders on the platform.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5,"align":"left","className":"uagb-heading-text"} -->

##### 2. Low Minimum Deposit

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

HotForex offers a Micro trading account with a minimum deposit of \$5. This is approximately 600 Kenya shillings. This low amount allows you to test the trading platform without investing so much of your capital.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Even better, HotForex offers leverage of up to 1:1000 on the micro account, allowing forex traders to control huge transactions with very minimal upfront investment. However, you should use leverage with a lot of care since it is a double edged sword.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Once you've tested and experienced how the HotForex trading platform works, you can then proceed and deposit more trading funds. We recommend at least \$250 minimum trading capital if you want to make substantial profits at the end of the day.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5,"align":"center","className":"uagb-heading-text"} -->

##### 3. Highly Regulated

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It is always a good idea to trade with licensed forex brokers in Kenya. And in that regard, HotForex scores a hundred percent. Not only is HotForex licensed and regulated by the Capital Markets Authority, but also has regulation from most of the top-tier jurisdictions. For instance, HotForex is regulated in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is one of the most coveted licenses an online forex broker can acquire.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Additionally, the forex broker hold licenses from other top jurisdictions including Seychelles' Financial Service Authority and the Dubai Financial Services Authority.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So, if you're looking for forex brokers with Mpesa, I highly recommend that you sign up with HotForex.
